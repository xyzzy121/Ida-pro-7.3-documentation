 Action    name: ShowUserScreen
 </pre>
This command displays the application screen.
<p>
It is useful for the text mode debugger.
<p>
When the debugged application runs in the same window as IDA itself,
the application output is hidden by IDA windows. This command allows
to see the application screen in this case.
<p>
To return to IDA display, press any key.
<p>
This command is available when the application is suspended or finished.
