 Action    name: ReadWriteTraceAdd
 </pre>
This command adds a read/write trace to the current address.
<p>
Each time the given address will be accessed in read or write mode,
the debugger will add a trace event to the <a href="1444.html">Trace window</a>.
<p>
In fact, read/write traces are nothing more than breakpoints with special properties: they don't stop
and they simply add a trace event when the breakpoints are reached.
<p>
Internally, the debugger will add a hardware breakpoint on the given address,
so all the restrictions for <a href="1407.html">hardware breakpoints</a> are also valid
for read/write traces.
