The -r command line switch is used to run the built-in
debugger without creating a database in advance.
The format is this switch is:
<pre>
  -rdebname{params}:pass@hostname:port+pid
</pre>
The explanation of the fields:
<pre>
  debname       Debugger name. Should contain the debugger
                module name. Examples: win32, linux. This prefix
                can be shortened or even completely
                omitted if there is no ambiguity
  params        Optional parameter for the debugger module
                The parameters from the appropriate configuation file
                can be specified here, separated by semicolons.
  pass          Password for the remote debugger server
  hostname      Host name or address of the remote debugger server
  port          Port number to use to connect to the debugger server
  pid           PID of the process to attach

</pre>
All fields except the first one are optional. See examples below for typical
command lines:
<pre>
  ida -rwin32 file args
        Run 'file' with command line 'args' in the local debugger
        We have to specify the debugger name to avoid ambiguities.
  ida -rwindbg+450
        Attach to process 450 on the local machine using the windbg backend
  ida -rl:hippy@mycom:4567+
        Connect to the remote linux computer 'mycom' at port 4567 using the
        password 'hippy' and display the list of processes running on it.
        Allow the user to select a process and attach to it.
  ida -rl@mycom /bin/ls e*
        Run '/bin/ls' command on the 'mycom' computer using the remote
        debugger server on Linux. Use an empty password and the
        default port number. Pass &quot;e*&quot; as the parameter to /bin/ls.
  ida -rl@mycom whobase.idb
        Run '/usr/bin/who' command on the 'mycom' computer using the
        remote linux debugger server. Use an empty password and the
        default port number. IDA will extract the name of the
        executable from the whobase.idb file in the local current
        directory. If the database does not exist, then this command
        will fail.
  ida &quot;-rwindbg{MODE=1}@com:port=\\.\pipe\com_1,baud=115200,pipe,reconnect+&quot;
        Attach using windbg in kernel mode. The connection string is
        &quot;com:port=\\.\pipe\com_1,baud=115200,pipe,reconnect&quot;. A mini database
        will be created on the fly.
</pre>
When the -r switch is used, IDA works with the databases in the following way:
<pre>
        - if a database corresponding to the input file exists and
        the -c switch has not been specified, then IDA will use the
        database during the debugging session
</pre>
<pre>
        - otherwise, a temporary database will be created
</pre>
Temporary databases contain only meta-information about the debugged process
and not the memory contents. The user can make a
<a href="1470.html">memory snapshot</a>
any time before the process stops. If IDA detects that a command will cause the process to exit or detach IDA,
it will propose to make a snapshot.
<p>
The rest of the command line is passed to the launched process.
<p>
In the case there is no input file (when attaching to an existing process, for example),
then the temporary database is created in the standard temporary directory.
For Windows, this directory is usually &quot;Local Setting\Temp&quot; in the user
profile directory.
