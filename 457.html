 Action    name: MakeName
 </pre>
This command gives name/renames/deletes <a href="424.html">name</a> for the current
item.
<p>
To delete a name, simply give an empty name.
<p>
If the current item is referenced, you cannot delete its name. Even if you
try, IDA will generate a <a href="609.html">dummy</a> name.
<p>
Local name
<pre>
  The name is considered to be defined only in the current function.
  Please note that IDA does not check the uniqueness of the local names
  in the whole program. However, it does verify that the name is unique for the
  function.
</pre>
Include in names list
<pre>
  Here you can also include/remove the name from the <a href="545.html">name list</a>.
  If the name is hidden, you will not see it in <a href="587.html">names window</a>.
</pre>
Public name
<pre>
  You can declare a name as a public (global) name. If the current
  assembler supports the &quot;public&quot; directive, IDA will use it.
  Otherwise, the publicness of the name will be displayed as a comment.
</pre>
Autogenerated name
<pre>
  An autogenerated name will appear in a different color.
  if the item is indefined, it will disappear automatically .
</pre>
Weak name
<pre>
  You can declare a name as a weak name. If the current
  assembler supports the &quot;weak&quot; directive, IDA will use it.
  Otherwise, the weakness of the name will be displayed as a comment.
</pre>
Create name anyway
<pre>
  If this flag is on, and if the specified name already exists,
  IDA will try to variate the specified name by appending a suffix to it.
