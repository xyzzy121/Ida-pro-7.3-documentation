 Action    name: ToggleDump
 </pre>
This command switches the current disassembly window mode between
dump mode and normal mode.
Initially all disassembly windows are in normal mode
so you can see instructions and data.
When you are in dump mode, no instructions or data are displayed.
All bytes of the program will be dumped
on the screen as plain bytes and in ASCII.
This command may be useful when you want to find something in the program visually.
Do not forget that many commands continue to work in dump mode.
For example, you can use binary <a href="579.html">search</a> command.
<p>
The text version supports only paragraph aligned addressing in the view.
Switching to the hex dump view and back may change the cursor position in the disassembly listing.
