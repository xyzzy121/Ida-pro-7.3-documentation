 Action    name: OpNumber
 </pre>
This command converts immediate operand(s) type of the
current instruction/data to a number. That way, you can
delete <a href="569.html">suspicious</a> mark of the item.
<p>
The number is represented in the default radix for the current processor
(usually hex, but octal for PDP-11, for example).
<p>
When you use this command, IDA deletes the <a href="477.html">manually</a> entered operand.
<p>
If the cursor is on the first operand (the cursor is before ',')
then the first operand will be affected; otherwise, all other operands will be
affected.
