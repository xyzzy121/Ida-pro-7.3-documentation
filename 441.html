 Action    name: ProduceLst
 </pre>
Enter a file name for the assembler listing file. IDA will write
the disassembled text to this file.
<p>
If you've selected a range on the screen using <a href="420.html">Drop Anchor</a>
command, IDA will write only the selected range (from the
current address to the anchor).
<p>
If some I/O problem (e.g. disk full) occurs during writing
to the file, IDA will stop and a partial file will be created.
<p>
Please note that <a href="421.html">demo</a> version cannot produce assembler
listing files.
