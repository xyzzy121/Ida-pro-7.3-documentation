 Action    name: StackTrace
 </pre>
Opens the stack trace window.
<p>
This window displays the function calls that brought the current instruction.
<p>
The top of the Stack Trace window lists the last function called by the program.
Below this is the listing for the previously called functions.
Each line indicates the name of the function which called the function represented
by the previous line.
<p>
Double clicking on a line jumps to the exact address of the instruction realizing
this call.
<p>
Currently, IDA uses the EBP frame pointer values to gather the stack trace information.
It will fail for functions using other methods for the frame.
