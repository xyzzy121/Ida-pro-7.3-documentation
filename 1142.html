Graph edges can have several colors. In graph view:
<pre>
 - Blue: a normal edge
 - Green: if the jump is taken (its condition is satisfied)
 - Red: if the jump is not taken
 - Blinking: when in the debugger, the edge that will be followed blinks
</pre>
And, in proximity view:
<pre>
 - Blue: Code cross-reference edge
 - Gray: Data cross-reference edge
</pre>
IDA highlights the current mouse items. If the mouse is hovered over an
edge, it is highlighted. If the mouse is hovered over a node, all
adjacent edges are highlighted. To turn off the highlighting, specify
the 'current edge' color as an undefined custom color.
<p>
The 'highlighted edge' and 'foreign node' colors are not used yet.
