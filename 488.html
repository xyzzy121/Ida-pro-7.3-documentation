 Action    name: OpenStackVariables
 </pre>
This command opens the stack variables window for the current function.
<p>
The stack variables are internally represented as a structure. This structure
consists of two parts: local variables and function arguments.
<p>
You can modify stack variable definitions here:
add/delete/define stack variables, enter comments for them.
<p>
There may be two special fields in this window: &quot; r&quot; and &quot; s&quot;.
They represent the size of the function return address and
of the saved registers in bytes.
You cannot modify them directly. To change them, use
<a href="485.html">edit function</a> command.
<p>
Offsets at the line prefixes represent offsets from the frame pointer register (BP).
The window indicator at the lower left corner of the window displays
offsets from the stack pointer.
<p>
In order to create or delete a stack variable, use data definitions
commands (<a href="453.html">data</a>, <a href="454.html">strlit</a>, <a href="455.html">array</a>, <a href="456.html">undefine</a>, <a href="457.html">Rename</a>).
Also you may define <a href="479.html">regular</a> or <a href="480.html">repeatable</a> comments.
<p>
The defined stack variables may be used in the program by converting
operands to <a href="474.html">stack variables</a>.
<p>
Esc closes this window.
