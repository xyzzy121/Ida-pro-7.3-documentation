If IDA finds out that your database has an old format, it will try to upgrade
the database to a new format.
The upgrade process is completely automatic, no user intervention
is needed. However, after upgrading your database, you will not be able to
work with it using old versions of IDA. That is why IDA asks your
confirmation before upgrading the database.
<p>
This feature works only for databases starting from IDA version 2.05.
