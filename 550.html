 Description:
        The current item has an operand marked as an offset,
        but IDA cannot find the offset base in the database.
</pre>
<pre>
 Possible reason(s):
        The database is probably corrupted.
        This may occur if the database was corrupted and repaired.
</pre>
<pre>
 What to do:
        Mark the operand again as an offset. Use one of the following
        commands:
         <a href="467.html">Convert to offset (DS)</a>
         <a href="468.html">Convert to offset (CS)</a>
         <a href="469.html">Convert to offset by any segment</a>
         <a href="470.html">Convert to offset by any user-specified base</a>
</pre>
