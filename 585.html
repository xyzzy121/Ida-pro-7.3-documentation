 Action    name: WindowOpen
 </pre>
The &quot;WindowOpen&quot; command opens a new window with the disassembly.
IDA automatically opens one disassembly window at the start.
<p>
If the current location is an instruction belonging to a function,
then the <a href="42.html">graph view</a> is available. You can toggle between
the text and graph view using the Space key. You can also switch to
proximity view by zooming out to the callgraph using the '-' key.
<p>
Use the disassembly <a href="451.html">editing</a> commands to improve the listing.
<p>
Use Shift-&lt;arrows&gt; or Alt-L to drop <a href="420.html">anchor</a>.
If you have a mouse, you can drop the anchor with it too.
<p>
A double click of the mouse is equvalent to the &lt;Enter&gt; key.
<p>
To the left of disassembly, there is an <a href="1385.html">arrows window</a> (GUI version).
Also the GUI version <a href="1386.html">highlights</a> the current identifier.
