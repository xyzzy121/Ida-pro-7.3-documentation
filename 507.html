 Action    name: CreateSegment
 </pre>
This command allows you to create a new segment.
<p>
If you select a range using the <a href="420.html">anchor</a>, IDA will propose the start
address and the end address of the selection as defaults for the segment bounds.
<p>
You need to specify at least:
<pre>
    - the segment start address
    - the segment end address (excluded from the range)
    - the segment base
</pre>
Click <a href="508.html">here</a> to learn about addressing model used in IDA.
<p>
If &quot;sparse storage&quot; is set, IDA will use special sparse storage method
for the segment. This method is recommended for huge segments.
Later, it is possible to change the storage method of any region using
<a href="1527.html">set_storage_type</a> IDC function.
<p>
If another segment already exists at the specified address,
the existing segment is truncated and the new segment lasts from the
specified start address to the next segment
(or specified end address, whichever is lower). If the old and the new segments
have the same base address, instructions/data will not be discarded by IDA.
Otherwise, IDA will discard all instructions/data of the new segment.
<p>
An additional segment may be created by IDA to cover the range after the end of the new segment.
