 Action    name: ToggleTraceInstructions
 </pre>
This command starts instruction tracing.
You can then use all the debugger commands as usual: the debugger will save all the
modified register values for each instruction.
<p>
When you click on an instruction trace event in the trace window,
IDA displays the corresponding register values preceding the execution
of this instruction. In the 'Result' column of the <a href="1444.html">Trace window</a>, you
can also see which registers were modified by this instruction.
By using this information, you can for example quickly determine which instruction
modified a specific register, or you can even backtrace the execution flow.
Note that the IP register is never printed in the 'Result' column, although it is usually
modified by almost any instruction (except perhaps some prefixed instructions like REP MOVSB, ...).
<p>
Internally, the debugger runs the current thread step by step
to properly obtain all the required register values.
This explains why instruction tracing is slower than a normal execution.
