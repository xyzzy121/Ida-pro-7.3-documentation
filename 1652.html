The PIN debugger is a remote debugger plugin used to record execution traces. It
allows to record traces on Linux and Windows (x86 and x86_64) from any of the
supported IDA platforms (Windows, Linux and MacOSX). Support for MacOSX targets
is not yet available. Please see the section <a href="1653.html">PIN support for MacOSX</a>
for more details on this subject.
<p>
To use the PIN debugger plugin the following steps must be carried out:
<pre>
  - Download the appropriate version of PIN from <a href="http://www.pintool.org">http://www.pintool.org</a>
</pre>
<pre>
  - <a href="1655.html">Build the PIN tool</a>
</pre>
<pre>
  - Configure the debugger specific options in
    Debugger Options, Set specific options.
</pre>
<pre>
  PIN debugger plugin has the following configuration options:
</pre>
<pre>
  - PIN Binary Path: Full path to the pin binary.
  - PIN Tool Path: Directory where the idadbg.so or .dll PIN tool resides.
  - Tracing options:
    - Instruction tracing: trace individual instructions
    - Basic block tracing: trace basic blocks
    - Function tracing: trace functions
    - Recording of register values: record register values or not. If
      this option is disabled, only EIP/RIP will be recorded.
  - PIN Tool options:
    - Autolaunch pin for &quot;localhost&quot;: When this option is set and
    the host name specified in Debugger, Process Options is &quot;localhost&quot;, the PIN
    tool will be executed by IDA. Otherwise IDA expects the PIN tool to be
    already running and listening. Please refer to
    <a href="1654.html">Connecting a remote PIN tool instance from IDA</a> for more details.
    - Debug mode: This flag allows one to see what's happening in the PIN tool
    side. It prints out some debugging information.
    - Extra-arguments: Additional command line arguments to be used when
    constructing the command line to launch PIN locally. The extra arguments can
    be added before the PIN tool specification (before '-t /path/to/pin/tool) or
    after the PIN tool (after '-t /path/to/pin/tool' but before '-- application').
    Please consult the section &quot;Command Line Switches&quot; of the Intel PIN manual
    for more details.
</pre>
Optionally you can launch PIN yourself and connect to it from IDA. See
<a href="1654.html">Connecting a remote PIN tool instance from IDA</a> for more
details.
