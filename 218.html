The file being loaded is not completely loaded to memory by the
operating system. This may be because:
        - the file is overlayed; IDA does not know this type of overlays
        - the file has debugging information attached to its end
        - the file has other type of information at the end
<p>
Anyway, IDA will not load the additional information.
