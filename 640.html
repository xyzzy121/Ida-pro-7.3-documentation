If a byte has relocation information attached to it, then
the value of this byte is changed when the file is loaded into
the memory by the system loader or linker.
Therefore, it doesn't make much sense (and sometimes it is simply illegal)
to modify the byte.
<p>
We recommend to return the original value of the byte(s).

You can see the relocation information attached to an item by using the
<a href="598.html">show internal flags</a> command.
