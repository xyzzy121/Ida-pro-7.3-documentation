IDA opens a special non-closable window at the start.
This window is called &quot;message window&quot;.
In this window you see various IDA messages.
<p>
If the message window is hidden behind other windows, you
will not see the IDA messages.
<p>
You can duplicate all messages appearing in this window to a file.
For this, you have to define an environment variable:
<pre>
        set IDALOG=logfile
</pre>
