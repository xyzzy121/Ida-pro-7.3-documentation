Any runtime error generates an exception. Exceptions terminate the execution.
It is possible to catch an exception instead of terminating the execution:
<pre>
        auto e;
        try
        {
          ... some statements that cause a runtime error...
        }
        catch ( e )
        {
          // e holds the exception information
          // it is an instance of the <a href="1577.html">exception</a> class
        }
</pre>
The try/catch blocks can be nested. If the current function has no try/catch blocks,
the calling function will be examined, and so on, until we find a try/catch block
or exit the main function. If no try/catch block is found, an unhandled exception
is reported.
<p>
It is also possible to throw an exception explicitly. Any object can be thrown.
For example:
<pre>
        throw 5;
</pre>
will throw value '5'.
