<title>REGULAR EXPRESSION SYNTAX SUMMARY</title>
<table width="100%"><tr valign="top"><td><h2>REGULAR EXPRESSION SYNTAX SUMMARY</h2></td>
<td width="64"><img src="ida55.bmp"/></td></tr></table>
The full syntax and semantics of the regular expressions that are supported by PCRE2 are described in the pcre2pattern documentation. This document contains a quick-reference summary of the syntax.
<p>
QUOTING

<pre>
  \x         where x is non-alphanumeric is a literal x
  \Q...\E    treat enclosed characters as literal


</pre>
ESCAPED CHARACTERS
<p>
This table applies to ASCII and Unicode environments.
<pre>
  \a         alarm, that is, the BEL character (hex 07)
  \cx        &quot;control-x&quot;, where x is any ASCII printing character
  \e         escape (hex 1B)
  \f         form feed (hex 0C)
  \n         newline (hex 0A)
  \r         carriage return (hex 0D)
  \t         tab (hex 09)
  \0dd       character with octal code 0dd
  \ddd       character with octal code ddd, or backreference
  \o{ddd..}  character with octal code ddd..
  \U         &quot;U&quot; if PCRE2_ALT_BSUX is set (otherwise is an error)
  \uhhhh     character with hex code hhhh (if PCRE2_ALT_BSUX is set)
  \xhh       character with hex code hh
  \x{hhh..}  character with hex code hhh..
</pre>
Note that \0dd is always an octal code. The treatment of backslash followed by a non-zero digit is complicated; for details see the section &quot;Non-printing characters&quot; in the pcre2pattern documentation, where details of escape processing in EBCDIC environments are also given.
<p>
When \x is not followed by {, from zero to two hexadecimal digits are read, but if PCRE2_ALT_BSUX is set, \x must be followed by two hexadecimal digits to be recognized as a hexadecimal escape; otherwise it matches a literal &quot;x&quot;. Likewise, if \u (in ALT_BSUX mode) is not followed by four hexadecimal digits, it matches a literal &quot;u&quot;.
<p>
CHARACTER TYPES

<pre>
  .          any character except newline;
               in dotall mode, any character whatsoever
  \C         one code unit, even in UTF mode (best avoided)
  \d         a decimal digit
  \D         a character that is not a decimal digit
  \h         a horizontal white space character
  \H         a character that is not a horizontal white space character
  \N         a character that is not a newline
  \p{xx}     a character with the xx property
  \P{xx}     a character without the xx property
  \R         a newline sequence
  \s         a white space character
  \S         a character that is not a white space character
  \v         a vertical white space character
  \V         a character that is not a vertical white space character
  \w         a &quot;word&quot; character
  \W         a &quot;non-word&quot; character
  \X         a Unicode extended grapheme cluster
</pre>
\C is dangerous because it may leave the current matching point in the middle of a UTF-8 or UTF-16 character. The application can lock out the use of \C by setting the PCRE2_NEVER_BACKSLASH_C option. It is also possible to build PCRE2 with the use of \C permanently disabled.
<p>
By default, \d, \s, and \w match only ASCII characters, even in UTF-8 mode or in the 16-bit and 32-bit libraries. However, if locale-specific matching is happening, \s and \w may also match characters with code points in the range 128-255. If the PCRE2_UCP option is set, the behaviour of these escape sequences is changed to use Unicode properties and they match many more characters.

  (?&lt;name&gt;...)    named capturing group (Perl)
  (?'name'...)    named capturing group (Perl)
  (?P&lt;name&gt;...)   named capturing group (Python)
  (?:...)         non-capturing group
  (?|...)         non-capturing group; reset group numbers for
                   capturing groups in each alternative


</pre>
ATOMIC GROUPS

OPTION SETTING

<pre>
  (?i)            caseless

  (?U)            default ungreedy (lazy)
  (?x)            extended (ignore white space)
  (?-...)         unset option(s)
</pre>
The following are recognized only at the very start of a pattern or after one of the newline or \R options with similar syntax. More than one of them may appear.   (*LIMIT_MATCH=d) set the match limit to d (decimal number)
<pre>
  (*LIMIT_RECURSION=d) set the recursion limit to d (decimal number)
  (*NOTEMPTY)     set PCRE2_NOTEMPTY when matching
  (*NOTEMPTY_ATSTART) set PCRE2_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART when matching
  (*NO_AUTO_POSSESS) no auto-possessification (PCRE2_NO_AUTO_POSSESS)
  (*NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR) no .* anchoring (PCRE2_NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR)
  (*NO_JIT)       disable JIT optimization

</pre>
BACKTRACKING CONTROL
<p>
The following act immediately they are reached:
<pre>
  (*ACCEPT)       force successful match
  (*FAIL)         force backtrack; synonym (*F)
  (*MARK:NAME)    set name to be passed back; synonym (*:NAME)
</pre>
The following act only when a subsequent match failure causes a backtrack to reach them. They all force a match failure, but they differ in what happens afterwards. Those that advance the start-of-match point do so only if the pattern is not anchored.   (*COMMIT)       overall failure, no advance of starting point
<pre>
  (*PRUNE)        advance to next starting character
  (*PRUNE:NAME)   equivalent to (*MARK:NAME)(*PRUNE)
  (*SKIP)         advance to current matching position
  (*SKIP:NAME)    advance to position corresponding to an earlier
                  (*MARK:NAME); if not found, the (*SKIP) is ignored
  (*THEN)         local failure, backtrack to next alternation
  (*THEN:NAME)    equivalent to (*MARK:NAME)(*THEN)


</pre>
CALLOUTS
<pre>
  (?C)            callout (assumed number 0)
  (?Cn)           callout with numerical data n
  (?C&quot;text&quot;)      callout with string data
</pre>
The allowed string delimiters are ` ' &quot; ^ % # $ (which are the same for the start and the end), and the starting delimiter { matched with the ending delimiter }. To encode the ending delimiter within the string, double it.
