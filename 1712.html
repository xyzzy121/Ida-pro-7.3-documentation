 Action    name: ResetUndo
 </pre>
This command clears the undo history. After it the Undo and Redo commands
become unavailable. However, once the user performs a new action, IDA will
again start journaling all database modifications.
<p>
A side effect of this command is fast autoanalysis: since there is no user
action to revert yet, IDA does not maintain undo buffers and this speeds up
the analysis.
