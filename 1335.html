Remote GDB Debugger module allows for debugging code using the GDB remote serial protocol.
For this, the debuggee must contain a so-called &quot;GDB stub&quot; that controls the
execution and handles the remote protocol commands. There are many implementations
of such stubs available with different capabilities. The module has been tested
with the following GDB stubs:
<pre>
 <a href="1343.html">gdbserver</a>: Windows (Cygwin), Linux (ARM, MIPS, PowerPC)
 <a href="1357.html">VMWare</a>: x86 (16/32 bit)
 <a href="1521.html">QEMU</a>: x86 (16/32 bit), ARM, MIPS, PowerPC
 <a href="1417.html">OpenOCD</a>: ARM
</pre>
It is quite possible that the module will work with other stubs.
Note that only x86, ARM, MIPS and PowerPC processors are supported at the moment.
<p>
Some GDB stubs support so-called &quot;monitor&quot; commands. For example, VMWare stub
can return extra info about system registers. Use the command line at the bottom
of the main IDA window to send such commands. The output will be displayed in the message window.
Hint: most stubs have a &quot;help&quot; command (if they support any commands at all).
<p>
The module also makes the following function available from IDC:
<pre>
 string <a href="1592.html">send_dbg_command</a>(string command);
</pre>

When using <a href="1502.html">instant debugging</a>, you will need to tell IDA on which CPU the
target is running. This is done in the <a href="1522.html">Remote GDB Debugger options</a> dialog,
available via &quot;Debugger specific options&quot; button in the Process options dialog shown when you
choose Remote GDB Debugger from the Run or Attach menu.
<pre>
 NOTE
</pre>
Many GDB stubs do not report the address that triggered a hardware breakpoint.
In this case, IDA will report a memory breakpoint hit as a generic TRAP signal.
Examine the previous instruction to see if it referenced a memory location
with breakpoint. When continuing from such a breakpoint, choose not to pass
the signal to the program.

IDA can be used together with a J-Link debug probe from SEGGER Microcontroller GmbH:
