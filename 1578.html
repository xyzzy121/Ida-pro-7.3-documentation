The slice operator can be applied IDC objects are strings.
<p>
For strings, the slice operator denotes a substring:
<pre>
  str[i1:i2] - substring from i1 to i2. i2 is excluded
  str[idx]   - one character substring at 'idx'.
               this is equivalent to str[idx:idx+1]
  str[:idx]  - substring from the beginning of the string to idx
               this is equivalent to str[0:idx]
  str[idx:]  - substring from idx to the end of the string
               this is equivalent to str[idx:0x7fffffff]
</pre>
Any indexes that are out of bounds are silently adjusted to correct values.
If i1 &gt;= i2, empty string is returned. Negative indexes are used to
denote positions counting from the end of the string.

<p>
String slices can be used on the right side of an assignment. For example:
<pre>
  str[0:2] = &quot;abc&quot;;
</pre>
will replace 2 characters at the beginning of the string by &quot;abc&quot;.
<p>
For objects, the slice operator denotes a subset of attributes. It can be
used to emulate arrays:
<pre>
  auto x = object();
  x[0] = value1;
  x[1] = &quot;value2&quot;;
</pre>
x[i1:i2] denotes all attributes with numeric values between i1 and i2 (i2 is excluded).
<p>
Any non-numeric attributes are ignored by the slice operator.
