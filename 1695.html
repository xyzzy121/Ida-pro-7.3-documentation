Sometimes in binary code we can encounter a pointer to the middle of a structure.
Such pointers usually do not exist in the source code but an optimizing
compiler may introduce them to make the code shorter or faster.
<p>
Such pointers can be described using shifted pointers. A shifted pointer
is a regular pointer with additional information about the name of the
parent structure and the offset from its beginning. For example:
<pre>
        struct mystruct
        {
          char buf[16];
          int dummy;
          int value;            // &lt;- myptr points here
          double fval;
        };
        int *__shifted(mystruct,20) myptr;
</pre>
The above declaration means that myptr is a pointer to 'int' and if we
decrement it by 20 bytes, we will end up at the beginning of 'mystruct'.
<p>
Please note that IDA does not limit parents of shifted pointers to structures.
A shifted pointer after the adjustment may point to any type except 'void'.
<p>
Also, negative offsets are supported too. They mean that the pointer points
to memory before the structure.
<p>
When a shifted pointer is used with an adjustment, it will be displayed with
the 'ADJ' helper function. For example, if we refer to the memory 4 bytes further,
it can be represented like this:
<pre>
        ADJ(myptr)-&gt;fval
</pre>
Shifted pointers are an improvement compared to the CONTAINING_RECORD macro
because expressions with them are shorter and easier to read.
