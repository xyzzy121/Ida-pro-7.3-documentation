 Action    name: OpenFunctions
 </pre>
A list of all functions in the program is displayed.
You can <a href="484.html">add</a>, <a href="486.html">delete</a>, <a href="485.html">modify</a> functions
using <a href="427.html">list</a> viewer commands.
<p>
Listed for each function are:
<pre>
        - function name
        - segment that contains the function
        - offset of the function within the segment
        - function length in bytes
        - size (in bytes) of local variables + saved registers
        - size (in bytes) of arguments passed to the function
</pre>
The last column of this window has the following format:
<pre>
        R - function returns to the caller
        F - far function
        L - library function
        S - static function
        B - BP based frame. IDA will automatically convert
            all frame pointer [BP+xxx] operands to stack
            variables.
        T - function has type information
        = - Frame pointer is equal to the initial stack pointer
            In this case the frame pointer points to the bottom of the frame
        M - reserved
        S - reserved
        I - reserved
        C - reserved
        D - reserved
        V - reserved
</pre>
If a function has its color set, its line is colored using the specified color.
Otherwise library and lumina functions are colored with the corresponding
color. Otherwise the line is not colored.
<p>
A bold font is used for functions that have definite (user-specified) prototype.
Also some plugins too may set this flag. Such prototypes are taken as is
by the decompiler, while other prototypes are considered only as a starting
point during decompilation.
<p>
It is possible to automatically synchronize the function list with the active
disassembler, pseudocode, or hex view. For that right click on the function
list and select &quot;Turn on synchronization&quot;.
