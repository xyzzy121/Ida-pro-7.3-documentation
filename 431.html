 Action    name: ReloadFile
 </pre>
This command reloads the same input file into the database.
IDA tries to retain as much information as possible in the database.
All the names, comments, segmentation information and similar will be retained.
<p>
Only the values of individual bytes will be changed.
<p>
This command works for some input file types only: if the file was loaded into the database with special settings, this command
may fail. In this case, use <a href="444.html">Dump database to IDC file</a>
command and reload the file manually.
