 Action    name: LoadHeaderFile
 </pre>
This command allows you to apply type declarations from a C header file
to the program.
<p>
IDA reads and parses the specified header file as a C compiler does.
In other words, it mimics the front-end of a C compiler with some restrictions:
<pre>
        - only type declarations are allowed. The function definitions
          in the input file are skipped
        - not all C++ header files are not supported, only simple classes can
          be parsed
        - the compiler specific predefined macros are not defined,
          you have to define them manually in the header file
</pre>
Don't forget to specify the compiler and memory model in
the <a href="1354.html">compiler setup</a> dialog box before loading a header file.
<p>
All type declarations found in the input file are stored in the current
database in the form of a type library. These type declarations can be used
to define new structure and enumeration definitions by pressing &quot;Add standard structure&quot;
or &quot;Add standard enum&quot; buttons in the
<a href="501.html">Add enum type...</a> and
<a href="491.html">Add struct type...</a>
dialog boxes.
<p>
In the case of an error in the input file, the error messages appear in
the message window. In any case, the function declarations that are already parsed
are not deleted from the database.
IDA stops parsing the input file when 20 errors occur.
