Any number of nodes can be collapsed into a single synthetic node. Such
a synthetic node contains a user-provided text instead of normal
disassembly listing. The 'group' command is available from the
right-click menu if there are selected nodes.
<p>
Even a single node can be used to create a group. This feature can be used to
collapse huge nodes into something manageable or to hide a group that consists of
one node.
<p>
After creating a group, IDA automatically refreshes the graph layout. If a
custom layout was present, it is not applied to the reduced graph.
However, the existing custom layout is not destroyed and will be re-used
as soon as the user switches to the full graph by deleting the group or
uncollapsing it.
<p>
The node groups can be nested: synthetic nodes can be used to create
other groups. This feature allows reducing the graph into a single node.
Each node can belong to only one group at a time.
<p>
Groups can be uncollapsed to display the original node content. The node
frames of the current uncollapsed group (the one with the mouse pointer)
are displayed with a special color. The default group frame color is
yellow. This way, the existing uncollapsed groups can be visualized by
hovering the mouse over the graph nodes.
<p>
There are also commands to collapse and uncollapse all groups in the
graph. They are available from the right click menu.
<p>
To edit the contents of synthetic nodes, use the 'set node text' button
on the node title. The 'rename' command can be used too.
<p>
IDA automatically remembers the graph groups and their state for each function.
