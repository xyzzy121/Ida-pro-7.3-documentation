 Action    name: Breakpoints
 </pre>
Opens the breakpoints window.
<p>
In this window, you can view information related to existing breakpoints.
Breakpoints are saved in the database, and restored as soon as possible
(once the memory becomes writeable).
<p>
The 'Pass count' column indicates how many times the program needs to hit the
breakpoint before being suspended (0 means &quot;always suspend&quot;).
