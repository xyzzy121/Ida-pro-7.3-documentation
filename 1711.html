 Action    name: Redo
 </pre>
This command reverts the previously issued <a href="1710.html">Undo</a> command.
It is possible to use Redo multiple times.
<p>
This command also reverts all changes that were done to the database after
the last Undo command, including the eventual useful modifications made by the
autoanalysis. In other words, the entire database is modified to get to the
exact state that it had before executing the last Undo command.
