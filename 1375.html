<pre>
The following environment variables are used by IDA:
<p>
TMP or TEMP     Specifies the directory where the temporary files will
                be created.
                Default: C:\TEMP
<p>
EDITOR          The name of the preferred text editor.
<p>
IDALOG          Specifies the name of the log file. Everything appearing
                in the message window will be dumped there.
                Default: none
<p>
IDALOG_SILENT   Suppress all output to the message window.
                If the IDALOG variable is set, messages will continue to
                be written to the log file. Otherwise, they will be lost.
<p>
IDADIR          Specifies the IDA directory.
                Default: the directory where IDA executable is located
<p>
IDA_LOADALL     The selected loader will load all segments without asking
<p>
IDAUSR          Specifies the directory for user-specific settings.
                Default: Windows:  %APPDATA%/Hex-Rays/IDA Pro
                         Linux:    $HOME/.idapro
                         Mac OS X: $HOME/.idapro
<pre>
                This variable can contain multiple paths, in which case they must
                be separated by the platform's path separator character (i.e., ';'
                on Windows, and ':' on Linux &amp; Mac OS X.)
</pre>
<pre>
          <b>NOTE:</b> Using %IDAUSR% for loading plugins.
</pre>
<pre>
                %IDAUSR% will be considered when scanning for plugins: for
                each directory component of %IDAUSR%, IDA will iterate on
                files in its &quot;plugins&quot; subdirectory, in alphabetical order.
</pre>
<pre>
                Plugins with the same case-insensitive file name (without
                extension) are considered to be duplicates and are ignored;
                only the first plugin with a given name will be considered.
                Thus, let's say %IDAUSR% is set to &quot;C:\my_idausr&quot;, and a file
                &quot;C:\my_idausr\plugins\DWARF.py&quot; exists, then
                &quot;C:\my_idausr\plugins\DWARF.py&quot; will be picked up first while
                &quot;%IDADIR%\plugins\dwarf.dll&quot; will be considered conflicting,
                and thus ignored.
</pre>
<pre>
                In addition, in each directory, IDA first looks for plugins
                with the native extension (e.g., &quot;.dll&quot; on Windows) and only
                then looks for files with extensions corresponding to
                extension languages (e.g., &quot;.idc&quot;, &quot;.py&quot;, ...)
                Consequently if two files, say &quot;foo.dll&quot; and &quot;foo.py&quot;, are
                present in the same directory, &quot;foo.dll&quot; will be picked first,
                and &quot;foo.py&quot; will be considered conflicting, and thus ignored.
</pre>
<pre>
          <b>NOTE:</b> Using %IDAUSR% for overriding configuration.
</pre>
<pre>
                %IDAUSR% will be considered when looking for configuration
                files, after the config file found in %IDADIR%\cfg has been
                read.
</pre>
<pre>
                After %IDADIR%\cfg\&lt;filename&gt; has been read &amp; applied, for
                each directory component of %IDAUSR%, IDA will look for
                cfg/&lt;filename&gt; in it, and, if found, read &amp; apply its
                contents as well.
</pre>
<pre>
                This enables users to have their own small, fine-tuned
                configuration files containing just the bits they wanted to
                override, stored in one (or more) folder(s) of their choosing.
</pre>
<pre>
          <b>NOTE:</b> Using %IDAUSR% for specifying themes
</pre>
<pre>
                %IDAUSR% will be considered when scanning for themes: for
                each directory component of %IDAUSR%, IDA will iterate on
                subdirectories in its &quot;themes&quot; subdirectory.
</pre>
<pre>
          <b>NOTE:</b> Using %IDAUSR% for providing additional loaders, processor
                modules, .til files, .sig and .ids files
</pre>
<pre>
                %IDAUSR% will also be considered when building the list of
                existing loaders, processor modules, .til, .sig and .ids files.
                The following directories will be inspected:
                       %IDAUSR%\loaders
                       %IDAUSR%\procs
                       %IDAUSR%\til\&lt;arch-name&gt;
                       %IDAUSR%\sig\&lt;arch-name&gt;
                       %IDAUSR%\ids\&lt;platform-name&gt;
</pre>
IDA_MINIDUMP    (Windows only) If IDA crashes, it creates a minidump file with
                the MiniDumpWrite(). Use this environment variable to specify
                MiniDump flags (a combination of MINIDUMP_TYPE flags as a
                hexadecimal number).
                If set to &quot;NO&quot;, IDA will not write a dump.
<p>
IDA_MDMP_INIT   (Windows only) Let IDA load dbghlp.dll on startup so it is
                used for crash dump file generation in case of a crash. If
                not set, IDA will load dbghlp.dll dynamically (if needed).
                Using this option may cause the Windbg debugger plugin to
                malfunction in case its dbghlp.dll does not match the one
                loaded by IDA.
<p>
IDA_NOEH        If set, disable IDA's own exception handler and let all
                possible crashes to be handled by the OS or active debugger.
                It is useful if you're debugging a crash in a plugin or
                processor module.
<p>
IDAIDS          Specifies the directory with the IDS files.
                Default: %IDADIR%\IDS
<p>
IDASGN          Specifies the directory with the SIG files.
                Default: %IDADIR%\SIG
<p>
IDATIL          Specifies the directory with the TIL files.
                Default: %IDADIR%\TIL
<p>
IDAIDC          Specifies the directory with the IDC files.
                Default: %IDADIR%\IDC
<p>
IDA_NONAMES     Disables the name resolution
<p>
IDA_NO_HISTORY  Disables updating file history
<p>
IDA_NORELOC     Disables processing of the relocation information
                for some file formats
<p>
IDA_NOEXP       Disables processing of the export information
                for some file formats
<p>
IDA_NOTLS       Disables processing of the TLS entries for some file formats
<p>
H8_NOSIZER      Disables the display of the operand sizes for H8 module
<p>
IDA_LOADALL     Load all segments of the input file without futher
                confirmations
<p>
IDA_DEBUGBREAKPROCESS (Windows only) IDA debugger will use the
                DebugBreakProcess() API to break into the process. Otherwise
                it will instead attempt to set temporary breakpoints for
                all threads.
<p>
IDA_NO_REBASE   IDA Debugger will not rebase the program when debugging.
                (This will be in effect even if the debugger plugin implements
                the rebase_if_required_to callback)
<p>
IDA_NOWIN       (Text MS Windows version only)
                Bypass the code trying to find out the foreground window.
                This code causes problems under WINE.
<p>
IDA_DONT_SWITCH_SCREENS
                (text version only)
                Tells IDA to keep only one screen even during local
                debugging sessions. For local debugging sessions,
                IDA keeps by default one screen for the
                debugged application and one screen for itself.
<p>
IDA_NOAUTOCOMP  Do not autodetect compiler for name demangling.
                If this variable is absent and the current compiler
                is one of MS, Borland and Watcom, the compiler
                is autodetected.
<p>
IDA_ELF_PATCH_MODE Overrides patch mode for the new ELF files.
                If this variable is defined, it must contain a number.
                Each bit of this number corresponds to an option from the
                following list:
<pre>
   0: Replace PIC form of 'Procedure Linkage Table' to non PIC form
   1: Direct jumping from PLT (without GOT) regardless of its form
   2: Convert PIC form of loading '_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_[]' of address
   3: Obliterate auxiliary bytes in PLT &amp; GOT for 'final autoanalysis'
   4: Natural form of PIC GOT address loading in relocatable file
   5: Unpatched form of PIC GOT references in relocatable file
   6: Mark 'allocated' objects as library-objects (MIPS only)
</pre>
The following variables are used to fine-tune the Linux version of IDA:
<p>
TVLOG    the name of the log-file
         if it is not defined, use syslog with LOG_WARNING priority
<p>
TERM     the terminal definition (see terminfo)
<p>
TVHEADLESS disable all output (for i/o redirection)
         if this variable defined, the TVOPT variable is ignored
         This environment variable also works also in graphical versions of
         IDA. When set, the graphical interface will not restore desktops,
         toolbars or show the main window.
<p>
TVOPT    the enduser flags. Has many subfields delimited by commas ','.
     noX11   - when libX11.so is not compatible
     noGPM   - when libgpm.so is not compatible
     ansi    -
          OR
     mono    - when the terminfo data of your display does not declare
               it as having the ANSI-color support
     ign8    - ignore '8bit as meta key' in the terminfo description
     xtrack  - if your xterm-emulator in telnet client does not support
               mode 1002 (only 1000), set this flag
     alt866  - do not encode pseudographic symbols (for the console with
               alt-font loaded)
     cyrcvt= - cyrilic conversion (oem/koi8r).
               possible values are:
       linux   - for linux russian users and PuTTY (in/out koi8r)
       kwin    - output in koi8 and input in cp1251 - any telnet
       windows - for many telnet and any linux users (in/out 1251)

We recommend to use the 'xterm-scokey' terminal type for remote clients.
<p>
When the terminal type is xterm-scokey, add  the following string
to /etc/inputrc (or to ~/.inputrc):
<p>
&quot;\e[.&quot;: delete char
<p>
When working on the console without GPM installed, append &quot;noGPM&quot; to TVOPT.
<p>
Russian users should append the following settings to the above:
