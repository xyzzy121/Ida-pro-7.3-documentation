The Android debugger has the following particularities and limitations:
<p>
- Android on ARM is supported (not on x86)
<p>
- Both ARM and Thumb mode code is supported
<p>
- Multithreaded applications can be debugged. However, since the operating
  system does not report thread deaths, they are reported only when
  the debugger notices that the thread is missing (for example, because
  there is an error when we try to suspend it)
<p>
- Apparently Android reports applications that are currently executing
  a system call as executing &quot;LDMFD SP!, {R4,R7}&quot; before the syscall.
  Once the syscall completes, the next instruction is reached.
<p>
- Hardware breakpoints are not supported.
