 Action    name: EditEnum
 </pre>
These commands allow you to define and to edit an enum type.
You need to specify:
<pre>
        - name of enum
        - its serial number (1,2...)
        - representation of enum members
</pre>
Each enum has its ID and a serial number. The ID is a number used to
refer to the enum, while a serial number is used to order enums
during output. Changing the serial number moves the enum to another place.
<p>
The serial number of an enum is displayed at the lower left corner of the window.
<p>
You can specify any number as a serial number,
IDA will move the enum to the specified place.
<pre>
        1 - the current enum becomes the first enum
        2 - the current enum becomes the second enum
        ...
</pre>
You also need to specify representation of enum constants. You may choose
from various number bases (hex,dec,oct,bin) and character constants.
<p>
You may specify the element width or leave it zero. Zero means the element
width is not specified. The allowed widths are the powers of 2 in the range of 1..64.
