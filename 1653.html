Recording traces on MacOSX target is not supported yet. Versions equal or prior to
2.12-55942 does not have support for the API PIN_SpawnInternalThread, which is
needed by IDA to communicate with the PIN tool.
<p>
However, it's possible to record traces from a Linux or Windows target using the
MacOSX version of IDA.
