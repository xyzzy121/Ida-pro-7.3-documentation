 Action    name: MakeAlignment
 </pre>
This command allows you to create an alignment directive.
The alignment directive will replace a number of useless bytes
inserted by the linker to align code and data to paragraph boundary
or any other address which is equal to a power of two.
<p>
You can select a range to be converted to an alignment directive.
If you have selected a range, IDA will try to determine a
correct alignment automatically.
<p>
There are at least two requirements for this command to work:
        - there must be enough unexplored bytes at the current address.
        - an alignment directive must always end at an address
          which is divisible by a power or two.
