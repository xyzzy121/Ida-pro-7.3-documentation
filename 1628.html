 Action    name: ToggleTraceBasicBlocks
 </pre>
This command starts basic block tracing.
You can then use all debugger commands as usual: the debugger will save all
addresses where a temporary basic block breakpoint was reached.
<p>
Internally, the debugger runs the current thread normally, setting temporary
breakpoints in the last instruction of every basic block of every function
referenced from the current function and also at any call instruction in
the middle of the traced basic blocks.
<p>
Basic block tracing is slower than normal execution but faster than
instruction or function tracing.
