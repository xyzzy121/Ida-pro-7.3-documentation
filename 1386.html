In the graphical version, IDA highlights the identifier under the cursor.
For example, if the cursor is on the &quot;EAX&quot; register, then all occurrences of &quot;EAX&quot;
will be displayed with the yellow background. This feature is meant to
make the program analysis easier by highlighting the interesting parts of
the disassembly. For example, if the user wants to see all references to &quot;EAX&quot;,
he just clicks on any &quot;EAX&quot; on the screen and all of them will be highlighted.
<p>
The selection is made by pressing the Up, Down, Left, Right keys or
by simply clicking on the identifier.
<p>
The selection is not changed by pressing the PageUp, PageDown, Home, End keys, using
the scrollbar, or pressing the Alt-Up, Alt-Down, Ctrl-Up, Ctrl-Down keys.
<p>
The Alt-Up and Alt-Down keys perform a search of the currently selected identifier
backward or forward respectively.
<p>
The Ctrl-Up and Ctrl-Down keys scroll the disassembly text.
<p>
IDA does not highlight the segment names at the line prefix because
it is not very useful.
<p>
It is possible to turn off the highlight. The appropriate checkbox is in
the <a href="1304.html">Options, General, Browser</a> tab.
