 Action    name: EditSegment
 </pre>
This command allows you to change segment attributes.
You can change all attributes except the segment base. To change the segment
base, you have to delete the segment and create it again.
<p>
Please use the following links to learn about the segment attributes:
<pre>
      <a href="515.html">How to change segment name</a>
      <a href="517.html">How to change segment class</a>
      <a href="516.html">How to change segment addressing mode (16/32)</a>
      <a href="518.html">How to change segment alignment</a>
      <a href="519.html">How to change segment combination</a>
</pre>
Changing the segment class may change the segment type.
<p>
MOVE ADJACENT SEGMENTS: means that the previous and next segments will
be shrunk or expanded to fill gaps between segments.
Click <a href="628.html">here</a> for more information.
<p>
DISABLE ADDRESSES: if set, when a segment is shrunk,
all information about bytes going out of the segment will be completely removed..
Otherwise, IDA will discard information about instructions/data,
comments etc, but will retain byte values so that another segment can be
created later and it will use the existing byte values.
<p>
If IDA creates 2 segments where only
one segment must exist, you may try
the following sequence:
<pre>
        - <a href="513.html">delete</a> one segment. Choose one with
          bad segment base value. Do not disable addresses occupied
          by the segment being deleted.
        - change bounds of another segment.
</pre>
Note that the <a href="507.html">create</a> segment command changes the boundaries of
the overlapping segment automatically.
<p>
Segments with the 'debugger' attribute are the segments whose memory contents
are not saved in the database. Usually, these segments are created by the
debugger to reflect the current memory state of the program.
<p>
However, the user can modify this attribute.
<p>
If it is cleared, then the segment will permanently
stay in the database after closing the debugger session. The database will reflect the
state of the segment which was at the time when the status is changed.
<p>
If it is set, then the segment will become a temporary segment and
will be deleted at the end of the debugging session.
<p>
The &quot;debugger segment&quot; checbkox is available only during debugging sessions.
<p>
The 'loader' segments are the segment created by the file loader. The
segment having this attribute are considered to be part of the input file.
<p>
A segment with the 'debugger' attribute set and the 'loader' attribute
not set is considered to be an ephemeral segment.
Such segments are not analyzed automatically by IDA.
<p>
&quot;Segment permissions&quot; group box can be used to modify Segment access permissions (Read/Write/Execute)
