Please enter a file name for the assembler include file. IDA will write
the information about the defined types (structures and enums) to this file.
<p>
If some I/O problem (e.g. disk full) occurs during writing
to the file, IDA will stop and a partial file will be created.

Please note that <a href="421.html">demo</a> version cannot produce assembler
