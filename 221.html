When IDA tried to delete bytes outside of any segment, the maximal number
of contiguous chunks is reached. This is NOT a fatal error.
<p>
Some bytes outside of any segment will be present =&gt; the output text
will be incorrect because of these bytes. However, you can delete them in the
output text using a text editor.
