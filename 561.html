 Description:
        In fact, this is not exactly a problem: IDA collects all the locations
        where it has decided to convert undefined bytes to
        instructions or data even if they don't have
        any references to them. We consider this decision as dangerous
        and therefore we provide you with a way to examine all such places.

<pre>
 What to do:
        Examine the result of conversion and modify the instructions
        or data if IDA has made a wrong conversion.
