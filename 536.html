A plugin module is a module written on C++ that provides additional
functionality to IDA.
<p>
Usually, a plugin is invoked through a hotkey or the menu system.
The registered and loaded plugins will appear in a special Edit|Plugins submenu.
A plugin may provide better analysis, automation of tedious tasks, etc.
<p>
The plugin modules reside in the &quot;plugins&quot; subdirectory of IDA.
IDA is able to find and load all the plugins from this directory
automatically.
<p>
However, you can write a configuration file and tell IDA how to load
plugins. To do so, you need to modify the &quot;plugins.cfg&quot; file in the
&quot;plugins&quot; subdirectory.
<p>
The format of this file is simple:
<p>
Empty lines and lines starting with ';' are comment lines.
Other lines must have the following structure:
<pre>
           menuname filename hotkey arg
</pre>
<pre>
 Example:
</pre>
<pre>
           Undefine undef    Alt-U  0
</pre>
If the filename doesn't include the file extension or the directory,
IDA will add them. The plugin modules have the following extensions:
<pre>
        Windows:        *.dll
        Linux:          *.so
        Mac:            *.dylib
</pre>
Note: plugins compiled with support for 64-bit address space, will
feature a '64' suffix before the extension. E.g., 'pdb64.dll'
