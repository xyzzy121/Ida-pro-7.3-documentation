<pre>
 Action    name: SetSegmentRegister
 </pre>
Relevant only for processors with the segment registers.
Currently this command works for IBM PC, TMS320C2, Intel80196, and PowerPC processors.
<p>
This command creates or updates a segment register
<a href="524.html">change point</a>.
<p>
See <a href="547.html">jump to segment register change point</a> for more info.

<h3>ALPHA DISASSEMBLY</h3>

<p>
For Alpha processors, the user must enter the difference between the real GP value
and the start of
the GOT (global offset table). For example:
<pre>
         .got
         ....
         ; gp points here
 label:
</pre>
If you want to specify that a register points to &quot;label&quot;, you must
calculate and enter the difference &quot;label-.got&quot; as the register value.
<p>
<h3>ARM DISASSEMBLY</h3>

<p>
The ARM processor module has a virtual segment register T which reflects the
state of the T bit of the processor state register (PSR). Therefore, the value
of this register controls THUMB/ARM mode. If its value is not zero, then
the disassembly will be in the thumb mode.
<p>
<h3>POWER PC DISASSEMBLY</h3>

<p>
For PowerPC processors, the user must enter an offset from the beginning of
the TOC to the TOC entry which contains the address of the target. An example:
<pre>
 TOC:    .toc
         ....
 sometc: .tc sometc[tc], datachunk
</pre>
If you want to specify that a register points to &quot;datachunk&quot;, you must
calculate and enter the difference &quot;sometc-TOC&quot; as the register value.
You can change the TOC value in the processor specific options (which is accessible
from the analysis options).
<p>
<h3>INTEL 80196 DISASSEMBLY</h3>

<p>
For Intel 80196NP/NU processors, the user must enter the value of WSR or WSR1
register. IDA will automatically take the new value into account.
