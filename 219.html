Some EXE files are built with overlays.
This means that the whole file is
not loaded into the memory at the start of
the program, but only a part of it. Other
parts are loaded by the program itself
into the dynamic memory or over some
subroutines of the program.  This fact
leads to many difficulties when you
disassemble such a program.

Currently,  IDA knows about overlays created by Borland and Microsoft C
and Pascal compilers.
