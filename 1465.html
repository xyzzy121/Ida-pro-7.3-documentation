The -O command line switch allows the user to pass options to the plugins.
A plugin which uses options should call the get_plugin_options() function
to get them.
<p>
Since there may be many plugins written by independent programmers,
each options will have a prefix -O in front of the plugin name.
<p>
For example, a plugin named &quot;decomp&quot; should expect its parameters
to be in the following format:
<pre>
        -Odecomp:option1:option2:option3
</pre>
In this case, get_plugin_options(&quot;decomp&quot;) will return the &quot;option1:option2:option3&quot;
part of the options string.
<p>
If there are several -O options in the command line,
they will be concatenated with ':' between them.
