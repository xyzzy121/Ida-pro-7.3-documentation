In the graph view, the current function is represented as a collection of
nodes linked together with edges. Nodes represent basic blocks and edges
represent code cross-references between them.
<p>
Only code items are visible in the graph view, data items are hidden. To
display them, switch to text mode by pressing Space. The graph view
is available for the instructions belonging to functions. IDA
automatically switches to text mode if the current item cannot be
displayed in graph mode. It also displays a warning, which we
recommend to hide away as soon as you become familiar with the concept.
<p>
The Space key can be used to toggle between the graph and text views.
