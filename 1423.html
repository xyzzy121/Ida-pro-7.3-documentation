 Action    name: Threads
 </pre>
Opens the threads window.
<p>
In this window, you can view all the threads of the debugged process.
Double clicking on a thread jumps to its current instruction (available only
if the process has been suspended). Double clicking also changes the current
thread for the hlpHelpDebugger[CPU] window.
<p>
The right click brings a popup menu, where you can suspend or resume threads.
The following thread states are possible:
<pre>
  - Running: the thread is running
  - Ready: the thread is ready to run but the application has been suspended
  - Suspended: the thread has been suspended by the user
</pre>
