PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
<p>
Release 10 of PCRE2 is distributed under the terms of the &quot;BSD&quot; licence, as
specified below. The documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the &quot;doc&quot;
directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data
in the testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.
<p>
The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to
optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when
the library is built.
