 Action    name: AppendFunctionTail
 </pre>
This command removes the function tail at the cursor from a function definition.
<p>
If there are several parent functions for the current function tail range,
IDA will ask to select the parent function.
<p>
After the confirmation, the current function tail range will be removed from the
selected function definition.
<p>
If the parent was the only owner of the current tail, then the tail will be destroyed.
Otherwise it will still be present in the database. If the removed parent was the owner
of the tail, then another function will be selected as the owner.
