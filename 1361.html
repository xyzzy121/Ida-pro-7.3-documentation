 Action    name: SetType
 </pre>
This command allows you to specify the type of the current item.
<p>
If the cursor is located on a name, the type of the named item
will be edited. Otherwise, the current function type (if there is a function)
or the current item type (if it has a name) will be edited.
<p>
The function type must be entered as a C declaration. Hidden arguments (like
'this' pointer in C++) should be specified explicitly. IDA will use the type
information to comment the disassembly with the information about function arguments.
It can also be used by the Hex-Rays decompiler plugin for better decompilation.
<p>
Here is an example of a function declaration:
<pre>
        int main(int argc, const char *argv[]);
</pre>
To delete a type declaration, please enter an empty string.
<p>
IDA supports the user-defined calling convention. In this calling convention,
the user can explicitly specify the locations of arguments and the return value.
For example:
<pre>
        int __usercall func@&lt;ebx&gt;(int x, int y@&lt;esi&gt;);
</pre>
denotes a function with 2 arguments: the first argument is passed on the stack
and the second argument is passed in the ESI register and the return value
is stored in the EBX register. General rules for the user defined prototypes are:
<pre>
  - the return value must be in a register
</pre>
<pre>
  - if the return type is 'void', the return location must not be specified
</pre>
<pre>
  - if the argument location is not specified, it is assumed to be
    on the stack; consequent stack locations are allocated for such arguments
</pre>
<pre>
  - it is allowed to declare nested declarations, for example:
    int **__usercall func16@&lt;eax&gt;(int *(__usercall *x)@&lt;ebx&gt;
                                             (int, long@&lt;ecx&gt;, int)@&lt;esi&gt;);
    Here the pointer &quot;x&quot; is passed in the ESI register;
    The pointed function is a usercall function and expects its second
    argument in the ECX register, its return value is in the EBX register.
    The rule of thumb to apply in such complex cases is to specify the
    the registers just before the opening brace for the parameter list.
</pre>
<pre>
  - registers used for the location names must be valid for the current
    processor; some registers are unsupported (if the register name is
    generated on the fly, it is unsupported; inform us about such cases;
    we might improve the processor module if it is easy)
</pre>
<pre>
  - register pairs can be specified with a colon like &lt;edx:eax&gt;
</pre>
<pre>
  - for really complicated cases <a href="1492.html">this syntax</a> can be used.
</pre>
IDA also understands the &quot;__userpurge&quot; calling convention. It is the same
thing as __usercall, the only difference is that the callee cleans the
stack.
<p>
The name used in the declaration is ignored by IDA.
<p>
Function declarations may have the __spoils keyword. It is used to specify
the list of registers spoiled by the function. The syntax is the following:
<pre>
   int __spoils&lt;eax, bh&gt; func(int x);
</pre>
If the __spoils keyword is present, the specified list overrides the standard
spoiled list. For x86, the standard spoiled list is &lt;eax, edx, ecx&gt;.
The spoiled list may be empty.
<p>
The following additional keywords can be used in type declarations:
<pre>
  _BOOL1          a boolean type with explicit size specification (1 byte)
  _BOOL2          a boolean type with explicit size specification (2 bytes)
  _BOOL4          a boolean type with explicit size specification (4 bytes)
  __int8          a integer explicit size specification (1 byte)
  __int16         a integer explicit size specification (2 bytes)
  __int32         a integer explicit size specification (4 bytes)
  __int64         a integer explicit size specification (8 bytes)
  __int128        a integer explicit size specification (16 bytes)
  _BYTE           an unknown type; the only known info is its size: 1 byte
  _WORD           an unknown type; the only known info is its size: 2 bytes
  _DWORD          an unknown type; the only known info is its size: 4 bytes
  _QWORD          an unknown type; the only known info is its size: 8 bytes
  _OWORD          an unknown type; the only known info is its size: 16 bytes
  _TBYTE          10-byte floating point value
  _UNKNOWN        no info is available
  __pure          pure function: always returns the same value and does not
                  modify memory in a visible way
  __noreturn      function does not return
  __usercall      user-defined calling convention; see above
  __userpurge     user-defined calling convention; see above
  __spoils        explicit spoiled-reg specification; see above
  __hidden        hidden function argument
  __return_ptr    pointer to return value; implies hidden
  __struct_ptr    was initially a structure value
  __array_ptr     was initially an array
  __cppobj        a c++ style struct; the struct layout depends on this keyword
  __ptr32         explicit pointer size specification (32 bits)
  __ptr64         explicit pointer size specification (64 bits)
  __shifted       <a href="1695.html">shifted pointer</a> declaration
  __high          high level prototype (does not explicitly specify
                  hidden arguments like 'this', for example)
                  this keyword may not be specified by the user but
                  IDA may use it to describe high level prototypes
