 Action    name: AskNextImmediate
 </pre>
This command searches for the first instruction or data byte
that contains the specified immediate value. The command is
relatively slow (but much faster than the text search), because it disassembles each instruction to
find the operand values.
<p>
If the immediate value in an instruction has been logically or bitwise negated,
then this command will check against the modified value. Example:
<pre>
        mov al, -2
</pre>
will be found if the user searches for the immediate value 2 but
not when he searches for 0xFE.
<p>
If the checkbox &quot;any untyped value&quot; is checked, then the &quot;value&quot; field is ignored.
IDA will look for all immediate values without type in this case.
