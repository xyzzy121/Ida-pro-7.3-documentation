 Action    name: JumpEnter
 </pre>
By pressing &lt;Enter&gt; you navigate in the program in the same
way as in a hypertext (the way the web browers and help screens use).
<p>
This is the easiest way to explore the program: just position the cursor
at the desired name and press &quot;@&lt;JumpEnter&gt;&quot;.
<p>
Your current address is saved in the <a href="542.html">jump stack</a>.
<p>
The <a href="539.html">Jump back</a> command (usually Esc) will return you back.
<p>
If the cursor is at a stack variable, a window with
<a href="488.html">stack variables</a> is opened and the definition of the
stack variable is displayed.
