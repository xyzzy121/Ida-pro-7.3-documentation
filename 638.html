Some bytes in program memory have no corresponding byte in the executable
file. For example, uninitialized data is not kept in the file.
OS/2 Warp and Window support compressed pages.
<p>
In this case, IDA cannot create a full difference file. It shows the skipped
byte addresses along with their values in the message window.
