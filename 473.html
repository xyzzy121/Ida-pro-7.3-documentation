 Action    name: OpEnum
 </pre>
This command converts immediate operand(s) type of the
current instruction/data to an <a href="499.html">enum</a> member.
Before using this command, you have to <a href="501.html">define</a> an enumeration type.
<p>
If the selected enum is a bitfield, IDA will try to build a bitfield
expression to represent the constant. Please note that for bitfields having
multiple constants with the same value some expressions won't be possible.
<p>
If a range is selected using the <a href="420.html">anchor</a>, IDA will perform
'en masse' conversion. It will convert
immediate operands of all instructions in the selected range to
symbolic constants. However, IDA will ask you first the lower and upper limits of
immediate operand value. If the operand value is &gt;= lower limit and
&lt;= upper limit then the operand will be converted to offset, otherwise it
will be left unmodified.
<p>
When you use this command, IDA deletes the <a href="477.html">manually</a> entered operand.
<p>
If the cursor is on the first operand (the cursor is before ',')
then the first operand will be affected; otherwise all other operands will be
affected.
