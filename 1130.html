IDA has a small graph overview window. It displays the whole graph in
the zoom out form and gives the user an idea about which part of the graph is visualized
on the main window.
<p>
Clicking on the graph overview window visualizes different parts of the
graph in the main window. It is also possible to click and drag the
focus frame - the main window will be refreshed accordingly.
<p>
The graph overview window is visible only in the graph view node. As
soon as another non-modal window gets focus, the graph overview is
closed. It automatically opens when a graph view is activated.
<p>
The graph overview is displayed by default. To hide it, right click on
the main toolbar background and select Navigation, Graph overview menu
item.
<p>
The graph overview window can be resized to accommodate really huge graphs.
