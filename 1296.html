 Action    name: RefreshMemcfg
 </pre>
This command refreshes the program segmentation and memory contents in IDA.
It is available only during a debugging session.
<b>NOTE:</b> this command is currently hidden from the user interface because IDA
does synchronize with the process memory automatically.
<p>
Please note that IDA itself tries to keep the program segmentation in sync
with the debugged process. However, in order to accelerate the debugger,
the synchronization is done only at major events, for example when dynamic library
gets loaded or unloadled or a thread is created or deleted. If the memory
configuration is changed because of a simple system call (think of VirtualAlloc),
IDA might miss it. Use the &quot;refesh memory&quot; command in these cases.
<p>
Note2: when IDA detects a discrepancy in the program segmentation, it will
automatically synchronize with the process.
