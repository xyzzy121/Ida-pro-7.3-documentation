The user can pan (shift) the graph by clicking with the left mouse
button on the graph background and dragging it. In the rare case when
there is no graph background visible on the screen, the Shift-click can
be used to move the graph. This can happen on very high zoom levels,
when the current node occupies the whole window.
<p>
The mouse wheel scrolls the graph vertically. If the Alt key is pressed,
it will scroll the graph horizontally.
<p>
The Page Up and Page Down keys scroll the graph vertically. The keyboard
arrows can scroll the graph if they reach the node border and cannot
jump to another node in the specified direction.
<p>
Scrolling the graph does not change the keyboard cursor position.
As soon as the graph is refreshed on the screen, IDA will scroll the
graph so that the keyboard cursor becomes visible.
