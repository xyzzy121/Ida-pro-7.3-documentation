This commands sends <a href="1704.html">metadata</a> about the current database to Lumina.
<p>
IDA will calculate checksums for all non-trivial functions in the database,
extract metadata about them, and send it to Lumina. The metadata includes
function names and types, user comments, operand types, etc.
<p>
If Lumina already has metadata about the involved functions, it will be replaced
only if the new metadata is better and more complete.
<p>
Only functions with non-trivial names are pushed by this command.
