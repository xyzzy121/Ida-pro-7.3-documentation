 Action    name: EditStruct
 </pre>
This command allows the user to accomplish two things:
  - it moves the current structure type definition to another place
    in the structure window
  - it allows the user to change the structure alignment
<p>
Each structure has its ID and serial number. The ID is a number used to
refer to the structure, while a serial number is used to order structures
during output. Changing the serial number moves the structure to another place.
<p>
The serial number of a structure is displayed at the lower left corner of the window.
<p>
You can specify any number, IDA will move the structure to the specified place.
<pre>
  1 - the current structure becomes the first structure
  2 - to the second place
  ...
</pre>
The structure alignment is used to calculate the padding bytes at the end of the
structure. The alignment must be a power of 2.
<p>
This command is available when you open a structure <a href="593.html">window</a>.
