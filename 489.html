 Action    name: ChangeStackPointer
 </pre>
This command allows you to specify how the stack pointer (SP)
is modified by the current instruction.
<p>
You cannot use this command if the current instruction does not belong to
any <a href="484.html">function</a>.
<p>
You will need to use this command only if IDA was not able to trace the value of the SP register.
Usually IDA can handle it but in some special cases it fails.
An example of such a situation is an indirect call of a function that
purges its parameters from the stack. In this case, IDA has no
imformation about the function and cannot properly trace the value of SP.
<p>
Please note that you need to specify the <b>difference</b> between the old and
new values of SP.
<p>
The value of SP is used if the current function accesses local variables
by [ESP+xxx] notation.
