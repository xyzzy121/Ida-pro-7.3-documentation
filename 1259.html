 Action    name: OpenLocalTypes
 </pre>
Each database has a local type library embedded into it.
This type library (til) is used to store types that are local to the current database.
They are usually created by <a href="1367.html">parsing</a> a header file.
<p>
This command opens the local types window. The user can manipulate local types
here:
<pre>
  - the existing types can be modified (the default hotkey is Ctrl-E)
  - the existing types can be deleted (the default hotkey is Del)
  - new types can be added (the default hotkey is Ins)
</pre>
Please note that Ins can be used to add many types at once. For that the user
just needs to enter multiple declarations, one after another in the dialog box.
<p>
However, Ctrl-E permits for editing of one type at a time. This may cause
problems with complex structure types with nested types. Nested types will not
be saved by Ctrl-E.
<p>
If the edited type corresponds to an idb type (struct or enum), then
the corresponding type will be automatically synchronized. If the user modifies
an idb type in the struct/enum windows, the corresponding local type will
be updated too. So the type synchronization works both ways.
<p>
Some types in this list are created automatically by IDA. They are
copies of the types defined in the <a href="593.html">Struct</a> or <a href="594.html">Enum</a> views.
Such types are displayed using in gray, as if they are disabled.
<p>
Types displayed in black are considered as C level types. Read <a href="1042.html">more</a>.
<p>
Each type in the local type library has an ordinal number and may have a name.
<p>
Be careful when deleting existing types because if there are references to
them, they will be invalidated.
<p>
A local type can be mapped to another type. Such an operation deletes the existing
type and redirects all its references to the destination type. Circular dependencies
are forbidden. In the case of a user mistake, a mapped type can be deleted and recreated
with the correct information.
