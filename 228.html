It might be because of one of the following reasons:
<p>
1. The name is ill-formed:
<pre>
        - it is a reserved word
          <b>NOTE:</b> IDA does not allow the use of register names as byte names.
        - it contains bad characters.
          The list of allowed characters is specified in IDA.CFG
        - it starts with a reserved prefix. Some prefixes are used
          by IDA to generate names. See <a href="609.html">Names Representation</a>
          dialog for the list of prefixes.
</pre>
2. The name is already used in the program. Try to use another <a href="424.html">name</a>.
   In order to know where the name is used, you can try to jump to it using
   <a href="545.html">Jump to the Named Location</a>
<p>
3. The address cannot have a name:
<pre>
     - IDA refuses to rename tail bytes (i.e. the second, third...
       bytes of instruction/data).
     - the address does not belong to the program
</pre>
