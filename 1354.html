 Action    name: SetupCompiler

This dialog box allows the user to specify the compiler used to create the
program along with the memory model, default calling convention, ABI and other
parameters.
<p>
Please note that while some combinations of the parameters are meaningless,
IDA doesn't check them for validity. It is up to the user to specify a correct
combination.
<p>
IDA tries to determine the correct values automatically.
<p>
The include directories are a list of directories that look for the standard C headers.
This parameter is used during parsing <a href="1367.html">C header files</a>.
The directories must be separated by ';' in MS Windows and ':' in Linux.
The predefined macros field has the same format and is used similarly.
Please note that IDA doesn't define any compiler-specific macros by default.
