 Action    name: MoveSegment
 </pre>
This command allows you to move segment(s) to another address.
Use it if the segment(s) are loaded at a wrong address.
<p>
This command shifts (moves) the selected segments in the memory to the target address.
There must be enough free space at the target address for the segments.
<p>
All information in the segment will be moved to the new address, but since the
addresses change, the disassembly might be not valid anymore (especially if the
program is moved to the wrong addresses and the relocation information is not
available).
<pre>
 Fix up relocations
</pre>
<pre>
        This option allows IDA to modify the references
        to/from the relocated segment(s). If it is turned
        off, the references might be wrong after the move.
