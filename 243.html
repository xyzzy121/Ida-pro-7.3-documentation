If &quot;create imports section&quot; in the file loading dialog is checked,
IDA will convert .idata section definitions to &quot;extrn&quot;
directives and truncate it so it will not contain empty lines.
<p>
Unfortunately, sometimes there is some additional data in .idata
section so you'll need to disable this feature if some information is
not loaded into the database.
<p>
IDA tries to detect additional data in .idata section automatically.
<p>
If you disable conversion of .idata section to a segment with &quot;extrn&quot;
directives, you will see
<p>
somename        dd      ?
<p>
instead of
<pre>
        extrn   somename
</pre>
directives.
<p>
Another impact is that the .idata segment will not be truncated in any way.
