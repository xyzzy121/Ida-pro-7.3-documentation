If you have selected a range before applying an operand conversion
command, IDA will display a dialog box.
<p>
You can choose a range of operands to perform an en masse operation:
<pre>
 ALL OPERANDS
 -----------
</pre>
The operation will be performed on all
operands as a toggle. For example, if you
ask to convert to a character, then all
non-character operands will become characters,
and all character operands will become non-chars.
<pre>
 OPERAND VALUE RANGE
 -------------------
</pre>
The operation will be performed on the <a href="569.html">void</a> operands
which contain immediate numbers in the specified range.
<pre>
 ... OPERANDS
 ------------
</pre>
This selection will convert all operands with the specified type to
undefined operands.
Example: all characters become non-characters.
<pre>
 NOT ... OPERANDS
 ---------------
</pre>
This selection allows to convert all operands that do not have the specified type
to the specified type. Example: all non-characters to characters.
<pre>
 NOT TYPED OPERANDS
 -----------------
</pre>
This selection allows to convert all operands without any type to the specified
type. Example: all operands with no type to characters.
<pre>
 APPLY ONLY IF POSSIBLE
 ---------------------
</pre>
IDA will check whether an operand can be represented with the specified type
(as a character constant, for example), and perform type conversion only if
the check is successful.
