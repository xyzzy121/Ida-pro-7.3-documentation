 Description:
        This problem occurs when IDA has converted unexplored bytes to
        instruction(s) and later found that the decision was wrong.
        For example:
</pre>
<pre>
                mov     ax, bx
                db 0FFh, 0FFh
</pre>
<pre>
        0FFh, 0FFh cannot be converted to an instruction, therefore
        the &quot;mov&quot; instruction cannot be here.
</pre>
<pre>
        In this case, IDA automatically destroys the instruction(s)
        and enlists the address as problematic.
</pre>
<pre>
 What to do:
        Examine the end result and modify it accordingly.
</pre>
