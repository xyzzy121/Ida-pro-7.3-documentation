 Action    name: KillSegment
 </pre>
This command allows you to delete a segment.
<p>
IDA will ask your the permission to disable the addresses occupied by the segment.
If you allow this operation, all information about the segment will
be deleted. In other words, IDA will discard the information about
instructions or data, comments etc.
<p>
If you check the &quot;disable addresses&quot; checkbox, IDA will mark the addresses
occupied by the segment as &quot;nonexistent&quot; in the program. You will lose *ALL*
information, including byte values.
<p>
It is impossible to disassemble the content of adresses not located in any
segment, therefore you must create a new segment if you want to resume the
disassembly of that part of the code.
<p>
You can also edit (see below) an adjacent segment to <a href="514.html">expand</a> it to those
addresses.
<p>
IDA will ask your the permission to disable addresses occupied by the segment.
If you give your permission, information about the segment will be
deleted, otherwise IDA will discard information about instruction/data,
comments etc, but retain byte values so that you will be able to create
another segment afterwards.
<p>
To disassemble the addresses occupied by the segment, you need to create a
new segment again (i.e. you cannot disassemble bytes without a segment).
You can also <a href="514.html">expand</a> another adjacent segment to
these addresses.
