Each node has a title bar with title buttons. The title bar can be used
to displace the node. Displacing nodes  or edges creates a custom layout. The
custom layouts are automatically saved in the database. If there is a
custom layout for the function, IDA never destroys it without your
explicit permission. This behavior has its drawbacks: when the nodes are
resized (because of added comments, for example), the old layout will be
retained and the nodes could overlap. In this case, the user can ask IDA
to redo the layout or manually move the overlapping nodes. To avoid
displacing nodes inadvertently, turn on the <a href="19.html">lock graph layout</a> option.

The user can also click on the edge layout points (edge bending points) and drag
them. If two edge layout points are too close, one of them will be deleted.
To create new edge layout points, use Shift-DoubleClick on the edge.
