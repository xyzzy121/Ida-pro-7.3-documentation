IDA maintains separate namespaces for each structure. For example, you can define
something like this:
<pre>
 xxx    struc
 xxx    db ?
 xxx    struc
</pre>
Beware, usually
assemblers have one common namespace and do not allow the mentioned above example.
<p>
An empty name cannot be specified.
<p>
This command is available when you open a structure <a href="593.html">window</a>.
<p>
If the cursor is on the structure name at the beginning of the structure definition,
IDA proposes to rename the structure. Otherwise, IDA proposes to rename a structure
field.
<p>
If a structure is being renamed, the option &quot;Don't include in the list&quot; means
that the structure will not be included
in the list of the structures which appears when the user applies the structure
definition (for example, when the user creates a variable of this structure type).
We recommend to mark this checkbox when you have defined all variables of
this structure type and want to reduce the number of choices in the list.
