Suspicious operands are the operands that need your attention
because they contain an immediate value that could be a
number or an offset. IDA does not know about it, so it marks these
instructions as 'suspicious'.  You can change the suspiciousness of the operands
using <a href="606.html">set lower limit of suspicious operands</a> and
<a href="606.html">set upper limit of suspicious operands</a> commands.
<p>
Data arrays are considered to be suspicious if the first element of the
data array is within the lower and upper suspicious limits. Values of other
elements are not examined.
<p>
You can disable the display of the 'suspicious' marks in the <a href="1369.html">Comments Dialog</a>.
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> We strongly recommend that before producing an ASM file you go
through all 'suspicious' marks and get rid of them.  After this you have
a certain level of confidence that the file has been
disassembled correctly.
