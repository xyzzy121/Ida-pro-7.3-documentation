Use graph view by default
<pre>
        IDA switches to graph mode for each 'jump' command.
</pre>
Enable graph animation
<pre>
        Animate the graph layout, movement, and group collapsing/uncollapsing.
        While animation takes time, it gives the user some idea what's going on.
</pre>
Draw node shadows
<pre>
        Display shadows for each graph node. Shadows are not displayed
        for really huge or ridiculously small nodes.
</pre>
Auto fit graph into window
<pre>
        Zoom the graph so that it occupies the whole window.
</pre>
Fit window max zoom level 100%
<pre>
        The 'fit window' command maximal zoom level is 100%.
</pre>
Re-layout graph if nodes overlap
<pre>
        IDA recomputes the graph layout if a node overlap is detected.
        The presence of a custom layout (if the user has displaced
        some graph nodes) effectively turns off this option.
</pre>
Re-layout graph uopn screen refresh
<pre>
        IDA recomputes the graph layout at each screen refresh.
        Turning this option off accelerates IDA but then
        a manual layout might be required after some operations.
</pre>
Truncate at the right margin
<pre>
        All nodes at truncated at the right margin. The right <a href="605.html">margin</a>
        is specified in the Options, General, Disassembly tab.
        This option narrows the graph but hides some information
        by truncating long lines.
</pre>
Lock graph layout
<pre>
        Locks the graph layout by ignoring attempts to displace
        nodes. This prevents the creation of custom layouts that might lead
        to ugly graph layouts when nodes change their sizes.
</pre>
PROXIMITY VIEW
<p>
Show data references
<pre>
        Show data cross-referenced items in proximity view.
</pre>
Hide library functions
<pre>
        Do not show data or code cross-references to library functions,
        only show cross-referenced local functions.
</pre>
Unlimited children recursion
<pre>
        Recurse until there are no more callees (children) of the currently
        selected central node and all of his children.
</pre>
Recurse into library functions
<pre>
        Displays children data or code cross-references from library
        functions.
</pre>
Max parents recursion
<pre>
        Maximum recursion level for displaying parents of the currently
        selected central node. The value '0' disables parents recursion.
</pre>
Max children recursion
<pre>
        Maximum recursion level for displaying children of the currently
        selected central node. The value '0' means no maximum recursion
        level.
</pre>
Max nodes per level
<pre>
        Maximum number of nodes to show per level of children and parents.
