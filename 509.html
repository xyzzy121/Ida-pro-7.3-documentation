IBM PC case
-----------
<p>
Suppose we need to create a segment occupying addresses F000:1000..F000:2000
Let's calculate linear addresses:
<pre>
        start = (0xF000 &lt;&lt; 4) + 0x1000 = 0xF1000
        end   = (0xF000 &lt;&lt; 4) + 0x2000 = 0xF2000
</pre>
The segment base must be selected so that the first offset in our segment
will be 0x1000. Let's find it using the following equation:
<pre>
        VirtualAddress = LinearAddress - (SegmentBase &lt;&lt; 4);
        0x1000         = 0xF1000 - (base &lt;&lt; 4);
</pre>
After solving this equation, we see that the segment base is equal to 0xF000.
(you see, this is really a very simple case :) )
<p>
Now, we can create a segment entering:
<pre>
        segment start address:  0xF1000
        segment end address:    0xF2000
        segment base:           0xF000
</pre>
Please note that the end address never belongs to the segment in IDA.
