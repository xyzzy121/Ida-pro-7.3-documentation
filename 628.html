When you edit the segment boundaries, you can check the &quot;move the adjacent segments&quot;
checkbox.
<p>
IDA will try to shrink/expand the previous
segment in order to move the beginning of the selected segment.
Of course, you cannot move the start of the segment 'too far':
<pre>
  - the segment must have at least 1 byte
  - the start address of the segment must be less than the end of the segment
  - no segments can be killed during moving
  - the segment cannot have bytes with negative offsets
</pre>
You cannot shrink a segment to zero bytes. A segment must have
at least one byte.
<p>
This command is mostly used when IDA does not detect the boundary
between segments correctly.
<p>
Sometimes, IDA creates 2 segments where only
one segment must exist. In this case, you should not use this command.
Use the following sequence instead:
<pre>
        - <a href="513.html">delete</a> one segment.
          Choose the one with the bad segment base value.
          Do not disable addresses occupied by the segment being deleted.
        - change boundaries of the other segment.
</pre>
Caution: moving the first segment of the program will
delete all information about the bytes between the old start of the segment
and the new start of the segment!
<p>
See also another command that changes segment bounds:
<pre>
 <a href="514.html">Edit Segment</a>
 <a href="506.html">Edit|Segments</a> submenu.</pre>
