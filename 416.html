IDA can analyze a program when it is not occupied performing
an action you prompted. You disassemble a program together with IDA, but your requests have priority.
<p>
The state of background analysis is shown on the upper right-hand corner
of the screen.
<p>
You can <a href="620.html">disable</a> autoanalysis, but in this case
some functions of IDA will produce strange results (e.g. if you try to
convert data into instructions, IDA will NOT trace all the threads of
control flow and the data will be converted into instructions only on
the screen...)
<p>
