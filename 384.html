get offset of the first member of a structure
     id            - structure type ID
returns: -1 if bad structure type ID is passed
         or structure has no members
         otherwise returns offset of the first member.
         <b>NOTE:</b> IDA allows 'holes' between members of a
               structure. It treats these 'holes'
               as unnamed arrays of bytes.
         <b>NOTE:</b> Union members are, in IDA's internals, located
               at subsequent byte offsets: member 0 -&gt; offset 0x0,
               member 1 -&gt; offset 0x1, etc...
