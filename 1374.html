 Action    name: LoadPdbFile
 </pre>
This command loads a PDB file.
<p>
If the program being disassembled has a companion PDB file, then
this command may be used to load information from the PDB file into the
database.
<p>
Please note that the PDB loader uses the system DLL IMAGEHLP.DLL to load
the PDB file. The system DLL may refuse to load the PDB file if it is from
another operating system version or for some other reason.
<p>
The system searches for the PDB file in the system directories (usually something
like \WINNT\Symbols) and in the current directory.
<p>
The LoadPdbFile command launches a special plugin PDB.DLL which can be run manually
using Edit-&gt;Plugins submenu. This plugin uses MS DIA DLLs to load the
debug information and therefore can load only the PDBs compatible with the currently
installed IMAGEHLP.DLL
<p>
Since PDB.DLL use the MS DIA DLLs that are available only on Windows, loading
PDB information on Unix requires a different setup. The user has to launch
the win32_remote.exe debugger server on a Windows computer. The PDB plugin on
Unix can connect to the debugger server and use it to load PDB files. Please note
that we do not debug anything here but use the win32_remote.exe utility to
extract information from PDB files and transfer it to IDA. To ensure
that everything works correctly, you have to provide the following things:
<pre>
  - the computer where the PDB.DLL or win32_remote.exe run must have
    the Microsoft Debugging Tools installed. In case of doubt please verify
    that the dia2dump.exe utility from Microsoft can run and load PDB files
    on that computer.
</pre>
<pre>
  - In the case of IDA running on Unix, there must be a network connection
    between the Unix computer and the computer where win32_remote.exe runs.
    You can edit the pdb.cfg file and specify where the remote
    Windows computer is located so you do not need to specify it each
    time when IDA needs to load PDB info.
</pre>
When you invoke this command a second time, it will ask for the name of the
input file and its loading address. This allows the loading of PDB files for
additional DLLs.
