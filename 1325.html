In this window the user can view values of selected variables.
<p>
Global variables (data item names) as well as variables that are local
to the current function can be added by pressing Ins.
<p>
Expressions can be added to the view as well, they will be considered as IDC
expressions.
<p>
Expressions may have a type cast at the beginning. For example
<p>
(int)0x12345678
<p>
means that the contents of the memory at the address 0x12345678 should be
displayed as an integer. Note: to display strings use &quot;char[]&quot; as the typo.
