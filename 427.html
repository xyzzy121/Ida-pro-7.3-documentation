The following commands work in the list viewers:
<p>
1. All usual movement keys: PgUp,PgDn,Home,End and arrows.
<p>
2. It is possible to position to a line simply by typing in the desired
   line number.
<p>
3. It is possible to position on a line by typing in its beginning.
   In this case the user can use:
        Backspace key to erase the last character typed in.
        Ctrl-Enter to find another line with the same prefix.
   Please note that List Viewer ignores the prefix of a line up to the last
   backslash (\\) or slash (/) if it exists.
<p>
4. Alt-T         search for a substring (case-insensitive)
   Ctrl-T        repeat last search
<p>
5. If the list is not in dialog mode, you can use the following keys:
   Enter         jump to the selected item in the last IDA View window
   Ctrl-E        edit the current item
   Del           delete the current item

6. Quick filtering is available using Ctrl-F. More complex filters can be
   defined with a right click (only the GUI mode).

7. The list can be sorted by any column by clicking on it. Please note that
   maintaining a frequently modified list sorted can be very time consuming,
   so try not to sort non-modal lists during the initial analysis.
   (sorting is available only in the GUI mode).
