In the IDC expressions you can use almost all C operations except:
<pre>
  complex assignment operations as '+='
</pre>
<a href="1582.html">Constants</a> are defined more or less like in C, with
some minor differences.
<p>
There are four type conversion operations:
<pre>
  long(expr)  floating point numbers are truncated during conversion
  char(expr)
  float(expr)
  __int64(expr)
</pre>
However, explicit type conversions are rarely required because all type
conversions are made automatically:
<pre>
  - addition:
        if both operands are strings,
          string addition is performed (strings are concatenated);
        if both operands are objects,
          object combination is performed (a new object is created)
        if floating point operand exists,
          both operands are converted to floats;
        otherwise
          both operands are converted to longs;
</pre>
<pre>
  - subtraction/multiplication/division:
        if floating point operand exists,
          both operands are converted to floats;
        if both operands are objects and the operation is subtraction,
          object subtraction is performed (a new object is created)
        otherwise
          both operands are converted to longs;
</pre>
<pre>
  - comparisons (==,!=, etc):
        if both operands are strings, string comparison is performed;
        if floating point operand exists,
          both operands are converted to floats;
        otherwise
          both operands are converted to numbers;
</pre>
<pre>
  - all other operations:
        operand(s) are converted to longs;
</pre>
If any of the long operands is 64bit, the other operand is converted to 64bit too.
<p>
There is one notable exception concerning type conversions: if one
operand is a string and the other is zero (0), then a string operation
is performed. Zero is converted to an empty string in this case.
<p>
The &amp; operator is used to take a reference to a variable. References
themselves cannot be modified once created. Any assignment to them
will modify the target variable. For example:
<pre>
        auto x, r;
        r = &amp;x;
        r = 1;   // x is equal to 1 now
</pre>
References to references are immediately resolved:
<pre>
        auto x, r1, r2;
        r1 = &amp;x;
        r2 = &amp;r1; // r2 points to x
</pre>
Since all non-object arguments are passed to functions by value, references are
a good way to pass arguments by reference.
