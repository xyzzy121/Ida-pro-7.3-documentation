 Action    name: TraceWindow
 </pre>
Opens the trace window.
<p>
In this window, you can view some information related to all traced events.
The tracing events are the information saved during the execution of a program.
Different type of trace events are available: <a href="1446.html">instruction tracing events</a> ,
<a href="1447.html">function tracing events</a> and <a href="1448.html">write</a>,
<a href="1449.html">read/write</a> or <a href="1450.html">execution tracing events</a>.
<p>
During the execution, the list of traced events is disabled, as it couldn't
be continuously synchronised with the execution without rendering the whole
tracing very slow.
<p>
If a '=' character is displayed in the 'Thread' and 'Address' columns, it indicates that the trace event
occurred in the same thread and at the same address as the previous trace event.
