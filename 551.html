        Two reasons can cause this problem:
          1.Reference to an illegal address is made in the program being
            disassembled;
          2.IDA couldn't find a name for the address but
            it must exist.
 What to do:
        1. If this problem is caused by a reference to an illegal address
            - try to enter the operand <a href="477.html">manually</a>
            - or make the illegal address legal by <a href="507.html">creating</a> a new segment.
        2. Otherwise, the database is corrupt.
