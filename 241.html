Many graph operations are applied to the selected nodes. The current
node is considered to be part of the node selection for all operations.
<p>
The graph nodes can be selected using the mouse. To select many nodes at
once, press and hold the Ctrl key during the mouse operation. The Alt
key removes nodes from the current selection.
<p>
Internally, IDA keeps track of the selected nodes and edge layout points.
Edge layout points are the points where edges are bent. If the current
selection is moved in the graph, the selected edge layout points are
moved too.
<p>
The default color for the title of the selected nodes is light gray.
Other node titles are displayed with white color.
