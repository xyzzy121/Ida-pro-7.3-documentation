<pre>
  IDA did not find the specified module in:
    - the current directory
    - the operating system directory (see switch <a href="417.html">-W</a>
      and configuration file parameters <a href="419.html">WINDIR,OS2DIR</a>)
</pre>
<pre>
  OR
        - the module cannot be accepted because:
        - the module name (recorded in the file) doesn't match
          the expected name
        - the module does not contains any exported names (all exported functions
          are exported by ordinal numbers)
</pre>
Entries imported by ordinal entries will not be commented. If IDA finds a module,
all entries that are imported by ordinal will be commented like this:
<pre>
  KERNEL_91:
                retf            ; INITTASK
                                  ^^^^^^^^^
                                  comment
</pre>
This comment will be propagated (<a href="480.html">repeated</a>) to all
locations which call this
entry:
<pre>
                call    far ptr KERNEL_91 ; INITTASK

</pre>
IDA searches all files named &quot;modulename.*&quot; for the module.
If you know that the imported module resides in another directory,
copy it to your current directory. If the module file name is different
from &quot;modulename.*&quot;,
rename it. After the database is loaded, you can
delete the copied module.
<p>
IDA also looks for file &quot;modulename.ids&quot;
  in the current directory
  in the IDS subdirectory of the directory where IDA.EXE resides
  in the PATHed directories
<p>
You can create such a file yourself. For an example, look at DOSCALLS.IDS
in the IDS subdirectory.
