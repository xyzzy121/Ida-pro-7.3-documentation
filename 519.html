Combination
<p>
A field that describes how the linker can combine the
segment with other segments. Under MS-DOS, segments with
the same name and class can be combined in two ways: they
can be concatenated to form one logical segment, or they
can be overlapped. In the latter case, they have either the
same start address or the same end address, and they
describe a common range in memory. Values for the field
are:
<pre>
  Private. Do not combine with any
           other program segment.
  Public.  Combine by appending at
           an offset that meets the
           alignment requirement.
</pre>
<pre>
  Stack.   Combine as for Public.
           This combine type forces
           byte alignment.
</pre>
<pre>
  Common.  Combine by overlay using
           maximum size.

</pre>
Changing segment combination changes only the segment definition
on the screen. Nothing else will happen.
