 Action    name: OpOffsetCs
 </pre>
This command converts the immediate operand of the
current instruction/data to an offset from the current segment (CS).
<p>
If the cursor is on the first operand (the cursor is before ',')
then the first operand will be affected; otherwise, all other operands will be
affected.
<p>
If a range is selected using the <a href="420.html">anchor</a>, IDA will perform
'en masse' conversion. It will convert
immediate operands of all instructions in the selected range to
offsets. However, IDA will ask you first the lower and upper limits of
immediate operand value. If the operand value is &gt;= lower limit and
&lt;= upper limit then the operand will be converted to offset, otherwise, it
will be left unmodified.

<p>
If this command is applied to a structure member in the <a href="593.html">structure window</a>,
then IDA will create an &quot;automatic offset&quot;. An automatic offset is an offset
with the base equal to 0xFFFFFFFF. This base value means that the actual
value of the base will be calculated by IDA when a structure instance is
created.
<p>
To create offsets to structure members, use <a href="472.html">Convert to struct offset</a>
