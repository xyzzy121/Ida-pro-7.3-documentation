 Action    name: RenameRegister
 </pre>
This command allows you to rename a processor general register to some
meaningful name. While this is not used very often on IBM PCs,
it is especially useful on RISC processors with lots of registers.
<p>
For example, a general register R9 is not very meaningful and a name like
'CurrentTime' is much better.
<p>
This command can be used to define a new register name as well as to remove it.
Just move the cursor on the register name and press enter.
If you enter the new register name as an empty string, then the definition
will be deleted.
<p>
If you have selected a range before using this command, then the definition will
be restricted to the selected range. But in any case, the definition cannot
cross the function boundaries.
<p>
You cannot use this command if the current instruction does not belong to
any <a href="484.html">function</a>.
