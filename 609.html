Dummy names are automatically generated by IDA. They are used to denote
subroutines, program locations and data.
<p>
Dummy names have various prefixes depending on the item type and value:
<pre>
  sub_          instruction, subroutine start
  locret_       'return' instruction
  loc_          instruction
  off_          data, contains offset value
  seg_          data, contains segment address value
  asc_          data, string literal
  byte_         data, byte
  word_         data, 16-bit
  dword_        data, 32-bit
  qword_        data, 64-bit
  byte3_        data, 3 bytes
  xmmword_      data, 128-bit
  ymmword_      data, 256-bit
  packreal_     data, packed real
  flt_          floating point data, 32-bit
  dbl_          floating point data, 64-bit
  tbyte_        floating point data, 80-bit
  stru_         structure
  custdata_     custom data type
  algn_         alignment directive
  unk_          unexplored byte
</pre>
You can change representation of dummy names.
IDA supports several types of dummy names:
<pre>
  0     loc_0_1234     segment base address relative to program base address
                       &amp; offset from the segment base
  1     loc_1000_1234  segment base address &amp; offset from the segment base
  2     loc_dseg_1234  segment name &amp; offset from the segment base
  3     loc_0_11234    segment relative to base address &amp; full address
  4     loc_1000_11234 segment base address &amp; full address
  5     loc_dseg_11234 segment name &amp; full address
  6     loc_12         full address
  7     loc_0012       full address (at least 4 digits)
  8     loc_00000012   full address (at least 8 digits)
  9     dseg_1234      the same as 2, but without data type specifier
 10     loc_1          enumerated names (loc_1,loc_2,loc_3...)
</pre>
If you have selected names type 10 (enumerated names), you may
renumber them using a checkbox. The process is relatively fast, surprisingly.
<p>
The best representation for MS DOS programs is #0,
for 16-bit processors - #7, and for 32-bit processors - #8.
You can change dummy names type any time you want.
<p>
You can also set up types of names included in the <a href="545.html">names list</a>.
IDA knows about the following types of names:
<pre>
        - normal names
        - public names
        - weak public or extern names
        - autogenerated (meaningful) names.
        - dummy (meaningless) names.
</pre>
Dummy names may be public or weak, but they never appear in the list of names.
You can specify the type of a name when you create or <a href="457.html">modify</a> it.
<p>
You can also set maximal length of new names. Old names will not be
affected by this parameter.
