The database was not closed after the last IDA session. Most probably
this happened due to a power fault, unexpected reboot of the computer,
or another abnormal session termination.
<p>
You may try to repair the database but the best solution would be to
use the intact packed database or use a backup.
<p>
The repairing may fail to recover the database.
