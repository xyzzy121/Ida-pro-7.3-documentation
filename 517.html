The segment class name identifies the segment with a class name
(such as CODE, FAR_DATA, or STACK). The linker places segments with
the same class name into a contiguous range of memory in the runtime
memory map.
<p>
Changing the segment class changes only the segment definition
on the screen. There are the following predefined segment class names:
<pre>
        CODE    -       Pure code
        DATA    -       Pure data
        CONST   -       Pure data
        BSS     -       Uninitialized data
        STACK   -       Uninitialized data
        XTRN    -       Extern definitions segment
</pre>
If you change segment class and the segment type is &quot;Regular&quot;,
then the segment type will be changed accordingly.
<p>
In order to set the segment type &quot;Regular&quot;, you should change the segment
class to &quot;UNK&quot;.
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Segment class names are never deleted. Once you
define a segment class name, you cannot reuse it as a name of another object.
