The demo version works only with new databases and doesn't save the disassembly
results in an IDB file.
<p>
Unlike the full version, it cannot create .ASM and .LST files.
<p>
The demo version will accept only some file formats as input.
Currently, the supported file formats are: PE, ELF, Mach-O
<p>
Note that it will stop working after a while: this is a demo, not a full version, isn't it? :)
