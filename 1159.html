1) The following actions can improve the speed of graph drawing:
<pre>
 - Turn off animation
 - Turn off node shadows
 - Specify identical top and bottom background colors
 - Turn off 'relayout' options (might lead to stale graph contents)
 - Turn off the graph overview window
</pre>
2) Printing the graph: the 'print' command is available at the
graph toolbar. The graph toolbar is visible by default but if you have
saved a <a href="1420.html">custom desktop</a> configuration in the past,
it will not be visible. To set it on, check the View, Toolbars, Graph view menu item.
<p>
3) Working with huge graphs: do not forget about the node groups and use them
to make the graph simpler.
