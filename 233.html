IDA cannot change the segment start address because this segment with the
new start address would overlap another adjacent segment. For example,
the following situation:
<pre>
  seg_a  starts at 0x0000 ends at 0x1000
  seg_b  starts at 0x1000 ends at 0x2000
  seg_c  starts at 0x2000 ends at 0x3000
</pre>
If you ask to change seg_c so that it starts at 0x500, you'll see this
error message, because the new seg_c would overlap seg_b.
<p>
Please note that the end address never belongs to the segment in IDA.
