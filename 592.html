 Action    name: OpenXrefs
 </pre>
This command opens the cross-references window. This window contains
all references to the current location.
<p>
You can use <a href="427.html">list viewer</a> commands in this window.
<p>
You can add and delete cross references here too by pressing Ins or Del.
Right clicking on the mouse will work too.
<p>
Add a cross reference: the from and to address, as well as the xref type should be specified.
<p>
Del a cross reference: if the 'undefine if no more xrefs' is check, then the instruction
at the target address will be undefined upon the deletion of the last xref.
IDA undefines instructions only if they do not start a function.
