Max packet size
<pre>
        Maximum packet size supported by the GDB stub (in bytes).
        Some stubs can crash on big packets, e.g. memory reads. IDA
        will try to split such requests in smaller chunks so that
        replies should fit in this size. You can enter -1 to
        autodetect (in this case IDA will use the size of the
        &quot;g&quot; packet reply as the max packet size).
</pre>
Timeout
<pre>
        Default timeout in milliseconds for remote GDB stub responses.
        Some targets can be slow to respond, so increase this value
        when having problems, e.g. with disappearing memory bytes.
</pre>
Run a program before starting debugging
<pre>
        Check to enable <a href="1587.html">external program options</a>.
</pre>
Processor
<pre>
        This option is only visible when <a href="1502.html">starting debugger without a database</a>.
        Use it to specify on which CPU the target is running. For some processors you can also
        specify the endianness.
</pre>
Software breakpoints at EIP+1
<pre>
        Most GDB stubs for x86 report software breakpoint hits with EIP one byte after
        the breakpoint address. However, some emulators report the actual breakpoint
        address. This option allows IDA to recognize such situations.
        Recommendations: uncheck for QEMU, check for others.
</pre>
Use CS:IP in real mode
<pre>
        When debugging real-mode (16-bit) code, the stub can send either
        just 16 bits of IP register or the full EIP (CS&lt;&lt;4 + IP).
        Enable this option in the former case.
        Recommendations: check for QEMU, uncheck for others.
