 Action    name: LoadIdsFile
 </pre>
This command loads an IDS file.
<p>
An IDS file contains information about well-known functions (such as
functions from MS Windows API), namely:
<pre>
        - their names
        - their ordinal number in the DLL
        - an eventual informative comment
        - the number of parameters passed on the stack
        - the number of parameters purged when returning
</pre>
IDS files are automatically loaded if they are found in the IDS
directory. This command allows you to load an IDS file from any
directory, even after the main file has been loaded into the
database.
