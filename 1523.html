At the bottom of the main IDA window, just above the status bar there is a input
field. It can be used to enter various commands. By default, it accepts IDC commands,
but plugins may register themselves as command language providers for it.
<p>
Currently, the following command line providers exist:
<pre>
  - <a href="157.html">idc</a>
  - python plugin
  - bochs debugger
  - windbg debugger
  - GDB debugger
</pre>
When these plugins are active, they will process the entered commands.
The current command language can be changed by clicking on the button to the left
of the input field. The current language can be set as default by choosing &quot;Default CLI&quot;
from the context menu of the command line.
<p>
The command line input field can be activated by pressing '.'. Esc switches back to the previous window.
