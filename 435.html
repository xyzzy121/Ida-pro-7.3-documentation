 Action    name: LoadDbgFile
 </pre>
This command loads a DBG file.
<p>
If the program being disassembled has a companion DBG file, then
this command may be used to load information from a DBG file into the
database. IDA loads DBG files automatically if it can find them
in the directory with the input file.
<p>
The built-in debug information loader cannot load NB10 format files and PDB files.
To load those files, please use a special plugin PDB.DLL which can be run manually
using Edit-&gt;Plugins submenu. This plugin uses MS Windows DLLs to load the
debug information and therefore has the following limitations:
<pre>
        - it works only under MS Windows
        - it will load only PDBs compatible with the currently
          installed IMAGEHLP.DLL
</pre>
