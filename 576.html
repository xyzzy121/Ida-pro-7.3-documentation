 Action    name: AskNextText

This command searches for the specified substring in the text
representation of the disassembly.
This command is a slow command, because it
disassembles each instruction to get the text representation.
IDA will show its progress on the <a href="620.html">indicator</a>.
You can interrupt this command pressing Ctrl-Break.
<p>
You may search for <a href="578.html">regular expressions</a> too.
<p>
If a range is selected using <a href="420.html">anchor</a>, IDA will search
for the specified substring in the range.
<p>
Note that this command searches the same as what you see on your
screen (and not in binary image).
