 Action    name: MakeUnknown

This command deletes the current instruction or data, converting
it to 'unexplored' bytes. IDA will delete the subsequent instructions if
there are no more references to them (functions are never deleted).
<p>
If you have selected a range using the <a href="420.html">anchor</a>, all the bytes in this range
will be converted into 'unexplored' bytes. In this case, IDA will not delete
any other instructions even if there are no references to them after the deletion.
