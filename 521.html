 Action    name: SegmentTranslation
 </pre>
A segment translation is a sequence of other segments to use
when resolving the references to instructions from the current segment.
Only code references are affected by the segment translation. Data references
can be redirected to the desired addresses by modifying the data segment
register.
<p>
This feature is available only for selected processors
(it is not available for IBM PC processors).
<p>
We hope it is easier to give an example than to give a formal definition.
Suppose we have 3 segments:
<pre>
                start   end
        A       0000    1000
        B       1000    2000
        C       3000    4000
</pre>
The instruction
<pre>
        call    1000
</pre>
in the segment C obviously refers to the segment B while the instruction
<pre>
        call    500
</pre>
refers to the segment A.
<p>
However, IDA does not try to link these references unless you tell it to do so:
include the segments A and B into a translation list of the segment C.
It means that you have to create a translation list
<pre>
        A B
</pre>
for the segment C.
<p>
Below is a more complicated example:
<pre>
                start   end
        A       0000    1000
        B       1000    2000
        C       1000    2000
        D       3000    4000
        E       3000    4000
</pre>
translations
<pre>
        B:      A
        C:      A
        D:      A B
        E:      A C
</pre>
allow you to emulate overlays (the first set is A B D, the second A C E)
<p>
IMPORTANT NOTE1: If you use the segment translations, make sure that all
segments have unique segment bases. If two segments are placed in the linear
address space so that
they must have the same segment base, you may assign different
<a href="591.html">selectors</a> with equal values to them.
<p>
IMPORTANT NOTE2:
IDA supports only one translation list per segment.
This translation is applied by default to all instruction in the segment.
If the segment uses other mappings, then these individual mappings
can be specified for each instruction separately by using the
<a href="469.html">make offset</a> commands.
<p>
IMPORTANT NOTE3:
Since only code references are affected by the segment translations,
try to create the RAM segment at its usual place (i.e. its linear
address in IDA corresponds to its address in the processor memory).
This will make all data references to it to be correct without any
segment translation. For the data references to other segments you'll
need to use the <a href="469.html">make offset</a> command for each
such reference.
